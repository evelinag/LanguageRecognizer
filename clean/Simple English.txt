early life change change source henry viii was born in greenwich his father and mother henry vii and elizabeth of york saw little of their children henry was their second son he had his own servants and minstrels and a fool named john goose he even had a whipping boy who was punished for henry when he did something wrong prince henry enjoyed music and was very good at it at the age of he could play many instruments including the fife harp viola and drums henry viii was also a scholar linguist musician and athlete at his early age he could speak fluent latin french and spanish he got tutored by the best tutors and he also had to learn jousting archery hunting and other military arts henry was very religious henrys older brother was called arthur arthur married a spanish princess catalina de aragon when he was fifteen prince arthur died within a few months of his wedding of tuberculosis at the age of but some say he died of plague or sweating sickness after his brother died henry viii bonded closely with catalina de aragon catherine of aragon later on they got married the couple had trouble getting married because in leviticus if a brother is to marry the wife of a brother they will remain childless that meant that catherine had to swear that her marriage with arthur had not been perfect young henry viii was now the heir to the throne while his father was alive he was watched so closely because the king feared for the safety of his only remaining male heir henry could go out only through a private door and then he was watched by specially appointed people no one could speak to henry he spent most of his time in his room which could only be entered through his fathers bedroom henry never spoke in public unless it was to answer a question from his father he kept his enthusiastic personality under control on public occasions because he feared his fathers temper he was given little training for his future role as king by his father and relied heavily on his counselors in the early years of his reign in henry vii died of tuberculosis as well and his son became king henry viii he was when he was crowned king and catherine was crowned queen consort reign change change source the most important event that happened in england when henry was the king was the countrys change in religion as his first wife catherine of aragon had only had one daughter and they did not have any sons to be his heirs henry asked the pope to give them a divorce the pope would not do this catherines nephew was charles v emperor of the holy roman empire and he was very powerful also catherines family ruled spain which was the largest catholic country henry then chose a new archbishop of canterbury a man called thomas cranmer henry knew that cranmer would do what he wanted and cranmer agreed that henry could have a divorce from catherine the pope was so angry that he excommunicated henry meaning henry was thrown out of the church henry fought back in he passed the act of supremacy which meant that the king not the pope was the head of the church in england he then forced all priests and bishops to accept him as the new leader anyone who refused was punished henry viii spent a lot of time at a magnificent building named hampton court that belonged to his friend cardinal wolsey he spent the equivalent of million renovating the court and building things such as tennis courts and jousting yards however cardinal wolsey failed to get an anulment for henry when he wished to divorce catherine of aragon many people think that this is the reason why henry sacked cardinal wolsey and took hampton court from him protestants thought that monasteries in which roman catholic monks and nuns lived had more money and land than the monks and nuns needed henry forced the monks and nuns to move out of the monasteries then henry gave their money and land to men who supported him most of the men who received money and land from the closed monasteries were protestants this event was called the dissolution of the monasteries after his divorce from catherine of aragon henry viii married anne boleyn who was younger than catherine and still able to have children when anne just like catherine only had a daughter and no sons henry blamed her for treason and had her beheaded by a french swordsman he then started looking for another wife henrys most loyal official thomas cromwell helped him to find a way to get rid of anne by finding people who said that she had been the lover of several other men anne was put on trial and found guilty and she was executed by having her head chopped off henrys third wife was jane seymour she soon gave birth to a son called edward although this made henry very happy a few days later jane died henry had loved her very much and he never got over his sadness at her death he lost interest in everything and became bigger in size he became angry with thomas cromwell when cromwell suggested that he should get married again after janes death after a while henry changed his mind as he still only had one son he realised that it might be a good idea to marry again and he agreed to marry anne of cleves a german princess when anne arrived henry did not think she was as pretty as she looked in the pictures he had seen and he was not satisfied with her anne was also unhappy and agreed to be divorced from henry after only a few months in the meantime henry had noticed a young lady at court called catherine howard and thought that she might make a good wife catherine howard was a cousin of henrys second wife anne boleyn henry and catherine got married in but catherine was much younger than henry and she soon got tired of him and started to flirt with other men after they had been married for just over a year henry found out that catherine had been having an affair with someone else she was found guilty of treason and was executed just like anne boleyn had been a few years before henrys sixth and last wife was called catherine parr she was a woman in her thirties who had already been married twice her first two husbands had been much older than she was and both had died henry thought that she would be more sensible and faithful than his other wives and he turned out to be right catherine parr stayed married to henry for over three years until he died but they did not have any children in an event named the field of the cloth of gold took place in calais which belonged to britain rather than france at the time it was organised by britain and therefore henry viii to celebrate peace between france and england because they had been at war for a long time music dancing food wine and culture dominated the event and millions of pounds was spent on the event in modern day money it is clear that no expense was spared the event lasted for two and a half weeks henry famously wrestled king francis i of france and lost after divorcing catherine of aragon henry began to suffer many different ailments he never again regained health he died on january and was buried in windsor castle henry was the father of two queens and one king they were mary i of england elizabeth i of england and edward vi of england none of them had any children of their own henry often liked to be captured in his portraits with either food or pets he had many pets henry was often seen with his dog he owned a white pug and was very aware of how much his dog represented him as a rich wealthy man in the act of union was passed under henrys rule which had a long lasting effect on wales as a nation the act of union meant that welsh people were forced to speak english and things such as road signs were translated in to english the royal family who were based in london were now officially in charge of wales however the act also meant that welsh citizens were given the same legal rights as the english so there was an up side to this new law more information change change source ives e w henry viii in the

logical problem of evil change change source a version of the problem of evil perhaps by epicurus goes as follows if a perfectly good god exists then evil does not there is evil in the world therefore a perfectly good god does not exist another argument goes god exists god is omnipotent omniscient and perfectly good a perfectly good being would want to prevent all evils an omniscient being knows every way in which evils can come into existence an omnipotent being who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence has the power to prevent that evil from coming into existence a being who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence who is able to prevent that evil from coming into existence and who wants to do so would prevent the existence of that evil if there exists an omnipotent omniscient and perfectly good being then no evil exists evil exists logical contradiction arguments such as these are about the logical problem of evil they attempt to show that the assumed propositions lead to a logical contradiction and so cannot all be correct a common response is that god can exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good some philosophers accept that arguments such as god allows evil in order to achieve the greater good of free will are logically possible and thus solve the logical problem of evil since the aim is only to defeat the assertion that god and evil are logically incompatible even a highly implausible instance of gods coexistence with evil is sufficient for the purpose philosophies of science have approached the problem from the angle of empiricism for logical positivism the issue with god is the lack of any independent method of verification in their view this makes the proposition god exists not true or false but meaningless a similar position points to the lack of any way the proposition might be falsified christians believe that at the second coming of christ god will put an end to evil and the works of the devil see the end of the book of revelation adolf hitler is sometimes used as a modern definition of evil hitlers policies and orders resulted in the deaths of about million people references change change source concise oxford dictionary tooley michael the problem of evil stanford encyclopedia of philosophy retrieved on july perhaps wrongly attributed to epicurus by lactantius who from his christian perspective regarded epicurus as an atheist according to reinhold glei the argument of theodicy is from a source which is antiepicurean reinhold f glei et invidus et inbecillus das angebliche epikurfragment bei laktanz de ira dei in vigiliae christianae pp larrimore mj the problem of evil wileyblackwell the internet encyclopedia of philosophy the evidential problem of evil nick trakakis meister chad introducing philosophy of religion routledge p isbn the internet encyclopedia of philosophy the logical problem of evil james r beebe ayer aj nd ed language truth and logic gollancz london lakatos imre proofs and refutations cambridge sanburn josh february top political icons adolf hitler time httpwwwtimecomtimespecialspackagesarticlehtml retrieved august del testa david w lemoine florence strickland john government leaders military rulers and political activists greenwood publishing group p isbn retrieved from httpssimplewikipediaorgwindexphptitleevilampoldid categories ethics logic philosophy theology
contents principles logical positivism operationalism examples comtean positivism references further reading on positivism other websites principles change change source in its strongest original formulation positivism could be thought of as a set of five principles the unity of the scientific method ie the logic of inquiry is the same across all sciences social and natural the aim of science is to explain and predict scientific knowledge is testable research can be proved only by empirical means not arguments alone research should be mostly deductive ie deductive logic is used to develop statements that can be tested theory leads to hypothesis which in turn leads to discovery andor study of evidence research should be observable with the human senses arguments are not enough sheer belief is out of the question science does not equal common sense researchers must be careful not to let common sense bias their research science should be as valueneutral as possible the ultimate goal of science is to produce knowledge regardless of any politics morals or values held by those involved in the research science should be judged by logic and ideally produce universal conditionals experiments must be able to verify a statement anytime and anywhere unlike materialists positivists do not make any claims about a primary substance such as matter they assume that we have data and that we interpret the data the idea of a material world with three dimensions is for positivists just a good model to handle the experiences of everyday life if astronomy has to deal with more complex data that cannot be handled consistently in such a model they will have to think of a different model early thcentury positivists like ernst mach said that the best model is the most economical model that is the model we can use best in calculations and predictions the idea that all physical laws could be useful dates back to auguste comte comte said that all theories were merely relatively true and that even isaac newtons law of universal gravitation was strictly speaking nothing but a social convention true until new data force us to find a better theory logical positivism change change source moritz schlick the founding father of logical positivism and the vienna circle this was an important development in early th century vienna led by moritz schlick and widened by ludwig wittgenstein it held not only that propositions were true or false but that statements which could not be verified shown to be either true or false were meaningless thus statements like there is a god or there is no god are not true or false but meaningless the whole idea was explained in english by a famous little book by aj ayer language truth and logic in operationalism change change source this was the idea of pw bridgman nobel prize in physics for it was that a concept in science was defined by the way one measured it if one thinks of electron spin or the curvature of space these are not everyday ideas in everyday life electrons are not seen and neither is space seen to be curved they rest on the results of experiments which measured fundamental properties like time light mass electrical charge and so on what bridgman meant is that their meaning is in the way the measurements were done examples change change source the special theory of relativity depended on operational definitions for simultaneous events and distance that is providing the operations needed to define these terms in quantum mechanics the notion of operational definitions is closely related to the idea of observables that is definitions based upon what can be measured operationalism is found in other sciences in psychology intelligence has often been defined as the result of measurement by a standard iq test obviously that is controversial because our everyday understanding of the word intelligence is much more complex and varied comtean positivism change change source thcentury positivism or comtean positivism included the outline of a proposed development this would lead from primitive explanations through religious thought and monotheism to positivism as the universal theory and scientific practice the theory was very influential among cultural historians it led comte to the creation a religion of humanity as a secular substitute for all religions this caused an outcry among scientists who were ready to adopt the scientific premises but not interested in creating a substitute religion one can today still visit temples in rio de janeiro porto alegre and curitiba in brazil and paris built by thcentury comtean positivists london had a society of positivists the turkish leader mustafa kemal ataturk was strongly interested in positivism as the basis of a secularisation of the nation he was trying to build the term positivism is today no longer connected to the construct of a secular religion but more to describe a scientific method references change

associative property of multiplication distributive property additive identity property multiplicative identity property additive inverse property multiplicative inverse property advanced algebra related pages references other websites history change change source early forms of algebra were developed by the babylonians and the greeks however the word algebra is a latin form of the arabic word aljabr casting and comes from a mathematics book almaqala fi hisabal jabr waalmuqabilah essay on the computation of casting and equation written in the th century by a famous persian mathematician muhammad ibn musa alkhwarizmi who was a muslim born in khwarizm in uzbekistan he flourished under almamoun in baghdad iraq through ad and died around ad the book was brought into europe and translated into latin in the th century the book was then given the name algebra the ending of the mathematicians name alkhwarizmi was changed into a word easier to say in latin and became the english word algorithm examples change change source here is a simple example of an algebra problem sue has candies ann has candies they decide to share so that they have the same number of candies these are the steps you can use to solve the problem to have the same number of candies ann has to give some to sue let x represent the number of candies ann gives to sue sues candies plus x must be the same as anns candies minus x this is written as x x subtract from both sides of the equation this gives x x what happens on one side of the equals sign must happen on the other side too for the equation to still be true so in this case when was subtracted from both sides there was a middle step of x x after a person is comfortable with this the middle step is not written down add x to both sides of the equation this gives x divide both sides of the equation by this gives x the answer is six if ann gives sue candies they will have the same number of candies to check this put back into the original equation wherever x was this gives which is true they both now have candies with practice algebra can be used when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way problems such as building a freeway designing a cell phone or finding the cure for a disease all require algebra writing algebra change change source as in most parts of mathematics adding z to y or y plus z is written as y z subtracting z from y or y minus z is written as y z dividing y by z or y over z is written as y z or yz yz is more commonly used in algebra multiplying y by z or y times z can be written in ways y z y z yz or just yz the multiplication symbol is usually not used because it looks too much like the letter x which is often used as a variable also when multiplying a larger expression parentheses can be used y z when we multiply a number and a letter in algebra we write the number in front of the letter y y when the number is then the is not written because times any number is that number y y and so it is not needed functions and graphs change change source linear equation for yx an important part of algebra is the study of functions since functions often appear in equations that we are trying to solve a function is like a box you can put a number or numbers into and get a certain number out when using functions graphs can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations a graph is a picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation or inequality true usually this is easy to make when there are only one or two variables the graph is often a line and if the line does not bend or go straight upanddown it can be described by the basic formula y mx b the variable b is the yintercept of the graph where the line crosses the vertical axis and m is the slope or steepness of the line this formula applies to the coordinates of a graph where each point on the line is written x y in some math problems like the equation for a line there can be more than one variable x and y in this case to find points on the line one variable is changed the variable that is changed is called the independent variable then the math is done to make a number the number that is made is called the dependent variable most of the time the independent variable is written as x and the dependent variable is written as y for example in y x this is often put on a graph using an x axis going left and right and a y axis going up and down it can also be written in function form fx x so in this example we could put in for x and get y put in for x would get y and for x would get y so there would be a line going thru the points and as seen in the graph to the right if x has a power of it is a straight line if it is squared or some other power it will be curved if it uses an inequality lt or gt then usually part of the graph is shaded either above or below the line rules of algebra change change source in algebra there are a few rules that can be used for further understanding of equations these are called the rules of algebra while these rules may seem senseless or obvious it is wise to understand that these properties do not hold throughout all branches of mathematics therefore it will be useful to know how these axiomatic rules are declared before taking them for granted before going on to the rules reflect on two definitions that will be given opposite the opposite of is reciprocal the reciprocal of is rules change change source commutative property of addition change change source commutative means that a function has the same result if the numbers are swapped around in other words the order of the terms in an equation do not matter when the operator of two terms is an addition the commutative property of addition is applicable in algebraic terms this gives note that this does not apply for subtraction ie commutative property of multiplication change change source when the operator of two terms is an multiplication the commutative property of multiplication is applicable in algebraic terms this gives note that this does not apply for division ie when associative property of addition change change source associative refers to the grouping of numbers the associative property of addition implies that when adding three or more terms it doesnt matter how these terms are grouped algebraically this gives note that this does not hold for subtraction eg see the distributive property associative property of multiplication change change source the associative property of multiplication implies that when multiplying three or more terms it doesnt matter how these terms are grouped algebraically this gives note that this does not hold for division eg distributive property change change source the distributive property states that the multiplication of a number by another term can be distributed for instance do not confuse this with the associative properties for instance additive identity property change change source identity refers to the property of a number that it is equal to itself in other words there exists an operation of two numbers so that it equals the variable of the sum the additive identity property states that the sum of any number and is that number this also holds for subtraction multiplicative identity property change change source the multiplicative identity property states that the product of any number and is that number this also holds for division additive inverse property change change source the additive inverse property is somewhat like the opposite of the additive identity property when an operation is the sum of a number and its opposite and it equals that operation is a valid algebraic operation algebraically it states the following additive inverse of is multiplicative inverse property change change source the multiplicative inverse property entails that when an operation is the product of a number and its reciprocal and it equals that operation is a valid algebraic operation algebraically it states the following multiplicative inverse of is advanced algebra change change source in addition to elementary algebra or basic algebra there are advanced forms of algebra taught in colleges and universities such as abstract algebra linear algebra and universal algebra this includes how to use a matrix to solve many linear equations at once abstract algebra is the study of things that are found in equations for example polynomials and matrices these things are known as algebraic structures understanding the properties of more complex algebraic structures can help us solve more complex equations many math problems are about physics and engineering in many of these physics problems time is a variable time uses the letter t using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems energy is e force is f mass is m acceleration is a and speed of light is sometimes c this is used in some famous equations like f ma and emc although more complex math beyond algebra was needed to come up with that last equation related pages change change

only their eyes to look at the stars they used maps of the constellations and stars for religious reasons and also to work out the time of year early civilisations such as the maya people and the ancient egyptians built simple observatories and drew maps of the stars positions they also began to think about the place of earth in the universe for a long time people thought earth was the center of the universe and that the planets the stars and the sun went around it this is known as the geocentric model of the universe ancient greeks tried to explain the motions of the sun and stars by taking measurements a mathematician named eratosthenes was the first who measured the size of the earth and proved that the earth is a sphere a theory by another mathematician named aristarchus was that the sun is in the center and the earth is moving around it this is known as the heliocentric model only a small group of people thought it was right the rest continued to believe in the geocentric model most of the names of constellations and stars that we have come from greeks of that time arabic astronomers made many advancements during the middle ages including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the earth renaissance to modern era change change source drawings of the moon by galileo his drawings were more detailed than anyone before him because he used a telescope to look at the moon during the renaissance a priest named nicolaus copernicus thought from looking at the way the planets moved that the earth was not the center of everything based on previous works he said that the earth was a planet and all the planets moved around the sun bringing the heliocentric model back to the light a physicist called galileo galilei built his own telescope and used it to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time he agreed with copernicus their ideas were also improved by johannes kepler and isaac newton who came up with the theory of gravity at this time the catholic church decided that galileo was wrong the pope gave the order to lock galileo up in his house and they did not let him write any more books until he died after galileo people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets uranus and neptune they also saw how stars were similar to our sun but in a range of colours and sizes they also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as galaxies and nebulae modern era change change source the th century saw important changes in astronomy in karl jansky discovered radio emission from outside the earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the electromagnetic spectrum to observe the sky those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy allowing more discoveries to be made the opening of this new window on the universe saw the discovery of entirely new things for example pulsars which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space the waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source the period after world war saw more observatories where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites normally by governments for example bernard lovell began radio astronomy at jodrell bank using leftover military radar equipment by the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world similarly the end of the s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at mauna kea in hawaii a good site for visible and infrared telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies mauna kea would eventually come to host very large and very accurate telescopes like the keck observatory with its meter mirror the next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry this allowed telescopes to be placed in space on satellites satellitebased telescopes opened up the universe to human eyes turbulence in the earths atmosphere blurs images taken by groundbased telescopes an effect known as seeing it is this effect that makes stars twinkle in the sky as a result the pictures taken by satellite telescopes in visible light for example by the hubble space telescope are much clearer than earthbased telescopes even though earthbased telescopes are very large space telescopes gave access for the first time in history to the entire electromagnetic spectrum including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere the xrays gamma rays ultraviolet light and parts of the infrared spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched as with other parts of the spectrum new discoveries were made from s satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum discoveries change change source discoveries broadly come in two types bodies and phenomena bodies are things in the universe whether it is a planet like our earth or a galaxy like our milky way phenomena are events and happenings in the universe bodies change change source for convenience this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found those found around stars are solar bodies those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies solar change change source planets asteroids comets galactic change change source stars diffuse objects nebulas clusters compact stars white dwarves neutron stars black holes cosmic change change source galaxies clusters superclusters phenomena change change source burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly these are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a burst of energy they include supernovas novas periodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way the name periodic comes from period which is the length of time required for a wave to complete one cycle periodic phenomena include pulsars variable stars noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago the signal from these events bounce around the universe until it seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity in this way it resembles noise the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy the most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions the principal astronomical example is cosmic background radiation methods change change source instruments change change source telescopes are the main tool of observing they take all the light in a big area and put in into a small area this is like making your eyes very big and powerful astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim telescopes make objects look bigger closer brighter spectrometers study the different wavelengths of light this shows what something is made of many telescopes are in satellites they are space observatories techniques change change source there are way astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens light from a distant source reaches a sensor and gets measured normally by a human eye or a camera for very dim sources there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen one technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using integration which is like longer exposures in photography integration change change source astronomical sources do not move much only the rotation and movement of the earth causes them to move across the heavens as light particles reach the camera over time they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible than the background until it can be seen telescopes at most observatories and satellite instruments can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures also images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours days or even months in the digital era digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by computer which overlays the images after correcting for movement aperture synthesis change change source with radio telescopes smaller telescopes can be combined together to create a big one which works like one as big as the distance between the two smaller telescopes adaptive optics change change source adaptive optics means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something to see it better data analysis change change source data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it the observation is first stored as data this data will then have various techniques used to analysisanalyse it fourier analysis change change source fourier analysis in mathematics can show if an observation over a length of time is changing periodically changes like a wave if so it can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern and find many things including new planets fields change change source a good example of a fields comes from pulsars which pulse regularly in radio waves these turned out to be similar to some but not all of a type of bright source in xrays called a lowmass xray binary it turned out that all pulsars and some lmxbs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found those lmxbs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes this section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy their period of importance and the terms used to describe them it should be noted that astronomy in the modern era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum although there is some evidence this is changing fields by body change change source solar astronomy change change source main page sun solar astronomy is the study of the sun the sun is the closest star to earth at around million miles away it is the easiest to observe in detail observing the sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed changes in the sun can affect the weather and climate on earth a stream of charged particles called the solar wind is constantly sent off from the sun the solar wind hitting the earths magnetic field causes the northern lights studying the sun helped people understand how nuclear fusion works planetary astronomy change change source planetary astronomy is the study of planets moons dwarf planets comets and asteroids as well as other small objects that orbit stars the planets of our own solar system have been studied in depth by many visiting spacecraft such as cassinihuygens saturn and the voyager and galactic astronomy change change source galactic astronomy is the study of distant galaxies studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own galaxy as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to observe galactic astronomers

in everyday talk we say things fall because the earth s gravity pulls on them we talk as if our weight was a given actually weight changes when the pull of gravity changes the moon is much smaller and the pull of gravity on the moon is about th that of earth so any object on the moon weighs th of its weight on earth what does not change is the amount of matter in an object that is called its mass on earth mass and weight are the same for practical purposes the trip to the moon shows they are not really the same from this we learn two things the weight of an object is variable its mass is constant the pull of gravity varies according to the mass of an object the earth pulls more strongly than the moon a person also exerts a gravitational pull but it is so tiny it is ignored for all practical purposes the earth has mass every particle of matter has mass so the earth pulls on every object and person and they pull on the earth gravity pulls on the mass and gives it weight gravity vs gravitation change change source these words mean almost the same thing in everyday use sometimes scientists use gravity for the force that pulls objects towards each other and gravitation for the theory about the attraction history of gravitational theory change change source newtons law of universal gravitation galileo change change source in the late th century galileo did a famous experiment about gravity where he dropped balls from the tower of pisa he later rolled balls down inclines with these experiments galileo showed that gravitation accelerates all objects at the same rate regardless of weight kepler change change source the man who really worked it all out was johannes kepler who after pages of calculations and many false starts and deadend ideas finally got these three laws keplers elliptical orbit law the planets orbit the sun in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus keplers equalarea law the line connecting a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of time keplers law of periods the time required for a planet to orbit the sun called its orbital period is proportional to the long axis of the ellipse raised to the power the constant of proportionality is the same for all the planets newton change change source in english mathematician isaac newton wrote the principia in this book he wrote about the inversesquare law of gravitation newton said that the closer two objects are to each other the more gravity will affect them his theory about gravitation was used to predict the existence of the planet neptune based on changes in the orbit of uranus newtons theory was later used to predict the existence of another planet closer to the sun than mercury when this was done it was learned that his theory was not entirely correct these mistakes in his theory were corrected by albert einstein s theory of general relativity newtons theory is still commonly used for many things because it is much more simple to work with than the theory of general relativity and is usually accurate enough for many uses dynamic equilibrium change change source why does the earth not fall into the sun the answer is simple but very important it is because the earth moving round the sun is in a dynamic equilibrium the speed of the earths movement creates a centrifugal force which balances the gravitational force between the sun and the earth why does the earth continue spinning because there is no force to stop it newtons first law if a body is at rest it remains at rest or if it is in motion it moves at the same speed until it is acted on by an external force there is a kind of analogy between centrifugal force and gravitational force which led to the equivalence principle of general relativity weightlessness change change source a situation when a things motion balances out the pull of gravity on it general relativity change change source the special theory of relativity describes systems where gravity is not an issue by contrast gravity is the central issue of the general theory of relativity in general relativity there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural straight paths instead gravity is seen as changes in the properties of space and time in turn this changes the straightestpossible paths that objects will naturally follow the curvature is in turn caused by the energymomentum of matter spacetime tells matter how to move matter tells spacetime how to curve for weak gravitational fields and slow speeds relative to the speed of light the theorys predictions converge on those of newtons law of universal gravitation newtons equations are used to plan journeys in our solar system general relativity has a number of physical consequences gravitational time dilation and frequency shift change change source schematic representation of the gravitational redshift of a light wave escaping from the surface of a massive body gravity influences the passage of time light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted whereas light sent in the opposite direction ie climbing out of the gravity well is redshifted collectively these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift more generally processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away this effect is known as gravitational time dilation light deflection and gravitational time delay change change source deflection of light sent out from the location shown in blue near a compact body shown in gray general relativity predicts that the path of light is bent in a gravitational field light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body this effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the sun closely related to light deflection is the gravitational time delay or shapiro delay the phenomenon that light signals take longer to move through a gravitational field than they would in the absence of that field there have been numerous successful tests of this prediction a parameter called encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space

predicted them in on the basis of his theory of general relativity in theory gravitational waves transport energy as gravitational radiation sources of detectable gravitational waves might include

home plate is a pentagon which is a shape that has five sides first base is on the right side of the field second base is at the top of the infield third base is on the left side of the field and home plate is at the back of the field where the catcher plays the game is played in innings professional and college baseball have nine innings in an inning each team has one turn to bat and try to score runs worth one point when one team bats the other team plays defense and tries to get three players on the other team out the team that is playing defense always has the ball this is different from other team sports when the team on defense gets three players out it is their turn to try and score runs then the team that was batting starts playing defense and the team that was playing defense starts batting after nine innings the team that has the most runs is the winner if the teams have the same number of runs they play more innings until one team wins at the start of the game the home team pitches while players on the visiting team bat only one player can bat at a time the baseball field or diamond has two main parts the infield and the outfield the infield is where the four bases

foul territory a ball that is hit with a bat and flies between the foul lines is a fair ball and the batter and runners can try and run around the bases and score a ball that is outside the foul lines is a foul ball if the ball hits the ground in the foul area rather than being caught in the air the batter continues to bat and any runners must return to the base that they were on before the ball was hit if the batter has fewer than two strikes a foul ball counts as a strike if the batter already has two strikes and the foul ball is not caught in the air then the batter continues to hit if a ball is caught by a fielder in fair or foul ground the batter is out a batter swinging at a pitched ball the most important part of the game is between the pitcher and the batter the pitcher throws or pitches the ball towards home plate the pitcher normally throws the ball close enough for the batter to hit it if the pitcher throws the ball in the strike zone which is the area over home plate and between the hitters knee and chest the pitch is a strike unless the batter hits the ball the pitch is always a strike regardless of where it is if the batter swings the bat and misses so the batter must have good aim with the bat three strikes are a strikeout and this is one way to make an out a pitch that the batter does not swing at and which is not called a strike is a ball on the fourth ball thrown by a pitcher the batter walks to first base so it is important to pitch well the catcher for the pitchers team waits behind the batter and catches any ball that the batter does not hit the catcher uses signals to tell the pitcher where to throw the ball if the pitcher does not like what the catcher says he will shake his head which signals no if he agrees with what the catcher has signaled he will nod his head which signals yes there are many ways to get batters out and runners can also be gotten out some common ways to get batters out are catching a batted ball in the air whether in fair or foul territory throwing the ball to the defensive player at first base an out if it gets there before the batter and a strikeout a runner can be put out by tagging the runner while the runner is not on a base and by forcing him out when a base is touched before a player can get there with no base for the runner to go back to when the fielding team has put out three of the batting teams players the halfinning is over and the team in the field and the team at bat switch places the batting team wants to get runs in order to get a run a player must bat then become a base runner touch all the bases in order and then touch home plate without being called out so first the batter wants to make other players get to home plate or to run the bases himself runners can not pass each other while running the basesin baseball the hitter hits it from up to down a base runner who touches home plate after touching all previous bases in order and without getting out scores a run if the batter hits the ball over the fence between the foul lines without touching the ground it is a home run the batter and any baserunners are allowed to advance to the home plate and score a run the fielding team can do nothing to stop them fielding team change change source the team on the field tries not to let the team who s batting get any runs the fielding team has a pitcher and a catcher the remaining seven fielders canstand anywhere in the field however there are usually four people that stand around the infield close to the bases and three outfielders who stand around the outfield the four infielders are the first baseman second baseman shortstop and third baseman the first baseman and third baseman stand close to first base and third base the second baseman and the shortstop stand on either side of second base the first basemans job is to make force plays at first base in a force play another infielder catches a ball that has touched the ground and throws it to the first baseman the first baseman must then touch the batter or the base with the ball before the batter can touch first base then the batter is out first basemen need to have quick feet stretch well be quick and know how to catch wild throws first base is one of the most important positions as a significant number of plays happen there the second basemans job is to cover the area to the right of second base and to back the first baseman up the shortstops job is to cover the area between second and third bases this is where righthanded batters usually hit ground balls the shortstop also covers second or third base and the near part of left field the shortstop is usually the best fielder on the team the third baseman needs to have a strong throwing arm this is because many times the batter will hit a ball toward third base the third baseman must throw the ball very quickly to the first baseman to get the runner out because the balls that go to third base are usually hit very hard the third baseman must also be very quick the three outfielders are called the left fielder the center fielder and the right fielder because they stand in left field center field and right field left field and right field are on the left and right sides if you look out from home plate center field is straight ahead from home plate center field is very big so the center fielder is usually the fastest the team can decide where to put the infielders and outfielders players often stand at slightly different places on the field between some plays these changes are called shifts the fielders may shift at any time players can shift for many reasons one of the more popular ones is the defensive shift where players move in the infield they do this because they know that some batters can only hit a ball a certain direction it can also be easier to make a double play when fielders are moved a certain way pitching change change source how the pitcher moves teams can change pitchers during a game teams change their pitchers often because it is hard for a pitcher to throw a full game of nine innings a pitcher can sometimes throw a nohitter where no one on the opposite team gets an earned hit a team can use as many pitchers as it wants to but it is rare to use more than eight in a game the ways that a pitcher throws the ball are called pitches many professional pitchers use two or more different pitches pitchers change which pitch they throw so that the batter will be tricked and not know what pitch to expect this makes it more difficult for the batter to hit the ball pitchers can make the ball move differently faster or slower closer or farther from the batter higher or lower there are also many types of pitches such as the slurve curve slider splitter sinker screw seam cut seam screw knuckle knuckle curve changeup circle changeup palm ball and others when throwing the ball the pitcher must touch the pitchers rubber with his foot the pitchers rubber is on top of the mound the pitcher cannot take more than one step forward when he throws the ball that makes the pitcher throw the ball slower many majorleague pitchers can throw the ball up to miles per hour kmh throwing a baseball that fast can be bad for the body pitchers can end up with a lot of injuries the batting team change change source the batting team wants to get runs the batting team sends its players up to home plate in a special order this order is called the lineup each team chooses its lineup at the start of the game after the game starts the team cannot change the order but the team can use a player who was not on the lineup the new player has to change with an original player the new players name is written in the lineup where the original players name was after the ninth player has batted the first player in the lineup starts again if a runner comes to home plate he scores a run then he is not a base runner after scoring a run the player must leave the field until it is his turn again so a player can only score one run for each time he bats since people began to have more free time baseball has become the national pastime of america about million people play baseball in the united states baseball terms change change source the field change change source see the image above for a diagram of the playing field base four points on the field the players must run to the player starts at home plate and must go to each of the other bases in order and return to home plate to score a run the other bases are named first base second base and third base home plate is a piece of hard rubber and the other bases are made of cloth in professional baseball the bases are feet from each other the bases on the field are in the shape of a diamond baseline the line between each of the bases in order for example from home plate to first base from first base to second base and so on base path the area along the baseline where the players run from base to base ball a pitch that was thrown outside the strike zone and that the batter did not swing at strike a pitch that was thrown inside the strike zone and that the batter did not swing at a pitch that the batter swung at and missed or a ball that the batter hit into foul territory dugout the place where the players and coaches who are not on the field sit bullpen the place where the pitchers watch the game and warm up before they start playing or when they are not playing the game change change source grounder a ball that bounces and rolls on the ground after being hit pop fly a ball that goes high in the air after being hit it can be caught for an out or it can fall for a hit double play when the defense gets two outs on one play often happens when a ground ball is hit to an infielder with a runner on base bunt when the batter holds his bat out to try and hit the ball rather than swinging it a bunted ball does not go far usually pitchers often bunt because they are not as good at hitting a bunt is also often used when trying to advance another runner already on one of the bases this is called a sacrifice or sacrifice bunt related pages change change source mlb references change change source the simple

smaller parts called branches these are subjects in psychology that try to answer a particular group of questions about how people think some branches of psychology that are often studied are cognitive psychology looks at how people think use language remember and forget and solve problems perceptual psychology asks questions about how people make sense of what they see and hear and how they use that information to get around social psychology looks into how groups of people work together and how societies build and work developmental psychology is interested in how people develop and change through their lives this includes what used to be called child psychology evolutionary psychology studies how evolution may have shaped the way people think and do things neuropsychology looks at the brain and how it works to make people the way they are abnormal psychology tries to work out what differences there are between people who are healthy and people who have a mental illness clinical psychology is about finding the best way to help people to recover from mental illness crosscultural psychology looks at different ways of living and views of the world educational or school psychology tests and helps students to learn and make friends motivation the root causes of action methods change change source scientific approaches change change source psychology is a type of science and research psychologists use many of the same types of methods that researchers from other natural and social sciences use psychologists make theories to try to explain a behavior or pattern they see based on their theory they make some predictions they then carry out an experiment or collect other types of information that will tell them whether their predictions were right or wrong some types of experiments cannot be done on people because the process would be too long expensive dangerous unfair or otherwise unethical there are also other ways psychologists study the mind and behavior scientifically and test their theories psychologists might wait for some events to happen on their own they might look at patterns among existing groups of people in natural environments or they might do experiments on animals which can be simpler and more ethical to study psychology shares other things with natural sciences as well for example a good psychological theory may be possible to prove wrong just like in any natural science a group of psychologists can never be completely sure that their theory is the right one if a theory can be proved wrong but experiments do not prove it wrong then it is more likely that the theory is accurate this is called falsifiability psychologists use many tools as part of their daily work psychologists use surveys to ask people how they feel and what they think they may use special devices to look at the brain and to see what it is doing psychologists use computers to collect data as they measure how people behave in response to pictures words symbols or other stimuli psychologists also use statistics to help them analyze the data that they get from their experiments symbolic and subjective approaches change change source not all psychology is scientific psychology psychodynamic psychology and depth psychology do things like interpreting peoples dreams to understand the unconscious mind as in older approaches to psychology begun by carl jung who was particularly interested in finding methods for measuring what kind of personality people have humanistic psychology and existential psychology also believe that it is more important to understand personal meaning than to find causes and effects of mental processes and behaviours psychologists change change source psychologists are people who work in the field of psychology a psychologist may work in either basic research or applied research basic research is the study of people or animals to learn more about them applied research is using what was learned from basic research to solve realworld problems if he or she is qualified as a clinical psychologist they may be a therapist or counsellor as well as a researcher to become a psychologist a person must first get a basic degree at a university and then go to graduate school a masters degree either msc master of science or ma master of arts allows beginning work like a school psychologist a doctorate degree takes a longer time because it includes doing research and writing a detailed report called a dissertation or thesis the doctoral graduate uses the initials phd or dphil doctor of philosophy after his or her name some clinical psychologists earn a doctor of psychology degree and use the initials psyd after their name the american psychological association says that people need a phd or psyd and a current state license in the us in order to call themselves a psychologist the words psychologist and psychiatrist may be confused with each other a psychiatrist has graduated from

contents history collecting data methods errors descriptive statistics finding the middle of the data mean median mode finding the spread of the data other descriptive statistics references history change change source statistics have been in use for a long time the first known statistics are census data the babylonians did a census around bc the egyptians around bc and the ancient chinese around bc collecting data change change source before we can describe the world with statistics we must collect data the data that we collect in statistics are called measurements after we collect data we use one or more numbers to describe each observation or measurement for example suppose we want to find out how popular a certain tv show is we can pick a group of people called a sample out of the total population of viewers then we ask each one how often they watch the show or better we measure it by attaching a counter to each of their television sets for another example if we want to know whether a certain drug can help lower blood pressure we could give the drug to people for some time and measure their blood pressure before and after methods change change source most often we collect statistical data by doing surveys or experiments to do a survey we pick a small number of people and ask them questions then we use their answers as the data the choice of which individuals to take for a survey or data collection is important as it directly influences the statistics when the statistics are done it can no longer be determined which individuals are taken suppose we want to measure the water quality of a big lake if we take samples next to the waste drain we will get different results than if the samples are taken in a far away hard to reach spot of the lake there are two kinds of problems which are commonly found when taking samples if there are many samples the samples will likely be very close to what they are in the real population if there are very few samples however they might be very different from what they are in the real population this error is called a chance error see errors and residuals in statistics the individuals for the samples need to be chosen carefully usually they will be chosen randomly if this is not the case the samples might be very different from what they really are in the total population this is true even if a great number of samples is taken this kind of error is called bias errors change change source we can reduce chance errors by taking a larger sample and we can avoid some bias by choosing randomly however sometimes large random samples are hard to take and bias can happen if different people are not asked or refuse to answer our questions or if they know they are getting a fake treatment these problems can be hard to fix see also standard error descriptive statistics change change source finding the middle of the data change change source the middle of the data is called an average the average tells us about a typical individual in the population there are three kinds of average that are often used the mean the median and the mode the examples below use this sample data name a b c d e f g h i j

 score mean change change source the formula for the mean is where are the data and is the population size see sigma notation this means that you add up all the values and then divide by the number of values in our example the problem with the mean is that it does not tell anything about how the values are distributed values that are very large or very small change the mean a lot in statistics these extreme values might be errors of measurement but sometimes the population really does contain these values for example if in a room there are people who make day and who makes day the mean of the data is day even though it is the average amount the mean in this case is not the amount any single person makes and is probably useless median change change source the median is the middle item of the data to find the median we sort the data from the smallest number to the largest number and then choose the number in the middle if there is an even number of data there will not be a number right in the middle so we choose the two middle ones and calculate their mean in our example there are items of data the two middle ones are and so the median is another example like the income example presented for the mean consider a room with people who have incomes of and the median is because is the average of the two middle numbers and if the extreme value of is ignored the mean is in this case the median is close to the value obtained when the extreme value is thrown out the median solves the problem of extreme values as described in the definition of mean above mode change change source the mode is the most frequent item of data for example the most common letter in english is the letter e we would say that e is the mode of the distribution of the letters for example if in a room there are people with incomes of and the mode is because occurs three times and all other values occur fewer than three times there can be more than one mode for example if in a room there are people with incomes of and the modes are and this is bimodal or has two modes bimodality is very common and often indicates that the data is the combination of two different groups for instance the average height of all adults in the us has a bimodal distribution this is because males and females have separate average heights of m ft in for men and m ft in for women these peaks are apparent when both groups are combined the mode is the only form of average that can be used for data that can not be put in order finding the spread of the data change change source another thing we can say about a set of data is how spread out it is a common way to describe the spread of a set of data is the standard deviation if the standard deviation of a set of data is small then most of the data is very close to the average if the standard deviation is large though then a lot of the data is very different from the average if the data follows the common pattern called the normal distribution then it is very useful to know the standard deviation if the data follows this pattern we would say the data is normally distributed about of every pieces of data will be off the average by less than the standard deviation not only that but about of every measurements will be off the average by less that two times the standard deviation and about in will be closer to the average than three standard deviations other descriptive statistics change change source we also can use statistics to find out that some percent percentile number or fraction of people or things in a group do something or fit in a certain category for example social scientists used statistics to find out that of people in the world are males references change change source wikimedia commons has media related to statistics moses lincoln e think and explain with statistics addisonwesley pp retrieved from httpssimplewikipediaorgwindexphptitlestatisticsampoldid category statistics

to decide between their options the cost of goods is what a person gives up for the goods when a person gives up something like money to get a good he also gives up other things that he could have gotten instead the true cost of something is what you give up to get it this includes money and the economic benefits utility that you didnt get because you bought or did that thing and can no longer buy or do something else this is called opportunity cost people react to incentives making an option more attractive will make more people choose it markets are usually good for the organisation of economic life in the free market goods will be shared by people and companies making small decisions the invisible hand of the market adam smith states that if everyone tries to get what they want everyone will be as welloff as they could possibly be sometimes prices do not fully show the cost or benefit to society for example air pollution is bad for society and education is good for society the government can put a tax or do something to reduce sales on items that are bad for society it can also support like giving money for items that are good for society the living standard of a

consider the month pillar to be the most important one in determining the circumstances of ones adult life the animals are also linked to traditional chinese agricultural calendar which runs alongside the better known lunar calendar instead of months this calendar is divided into two week segments known as solar terms each animal is linked to two of these solar terms for a period similar to the western month unlike the year lunar calendar which can vary by as much as a month in relation to the western calendar the agricultural calendar varies by only one day beginning on the western february or every year again unlike the cycle of the lunar years which begins with the rat the agricultural calendar begins with the tiger as it is the first animal of spring around summer days are longer than winter days because it occurs differences of perihelion and aphelion as each sign is linked to a month of the solar year it is thereby also linked to a season each of the elements is also linked to a season see above and the element that shares a season with a sign is known as that signs fixed element in other words that element is believed to impart some of its characteristics to the sign concerned the fixed element of each sign applies also to the year and hour signs and not just the monthly sign it is important to note that the fixed element is separate from the cycle of elements

twohour period divided by animals determining this period depends on knowing an individuals exact time of birth the secret animal is thought to be a persons truest representation since this animal is determined by the smallest denominator a persons birth hour as this sign is based on the position of the sun in the sky and not the time shown on a local clock followers of this system believe it to be important to compensate for daylight saving time however some online systems already compensate for daylight saving time and astrologers may compensate for this as well even though a client may already have compensated for it leading to a theoretically inaccurate reading within the four pillars the hour is the pillar representing information about ones children and contributions to the world or later life london amp solar time rat ox tiger rabbit dragon snake horse goat monkey rooster dog pig the times above are based on local solar time rather than standard time to convert to standard

removed february see astrological aspecttrine first trine edit the first trine consists of the rat dragon and monkey these three signs are said to be intense and powerful individuals capable of great good who make great leaders but are rather unpredictable the three are said to be intelligent magnanimous charismatic charming authoritative confident eloquent and artistic but can be manipulative jealous selfish aggressive vindictive or deceitful second trine edit the second trine consists of the ox snake and rooster these three signs are said to possess endurance and application with slow accumulation of energy meticulous at planning but tending to hold fixed opinions the three are said to be hardworking modest industrious loyal philosophical patient goodhearted and morally upright but can also be selfrighteous egotistical vain judgmental narrowminded or petty third trine edit the third trine consists of the tiger horse and dog these three signs are said to seek true love to pursue humanitarian causes to be idealistic and independent but tending to be impulsive the three are said to be productive enthusiastic independent engaging dynamic honourable loyal and protective but can also be rash rebellious quarrelsome anxious disagreeable or stubborn fourth trine edit the fourth trine consists of the rabbit goat and pig these three signs are said to have a calm nature and an intellectual approach they seek aesthetic beauty and are artistic wellmannered and compassionate yet detached and resigned to their condition the three are said to be caring selfsacrificing obliging sensible creative empathetic tactful and prudent but can also be naive pedantic insecure cunning indecisive or pessimistic zodiac origin stories edit there are many stories and fables to explain the beginning of the zodiac since the han dynasty the earthly branches have been used to record the time of day however for the sake of entertainment and convenience they have been replaced by the animals the hours are divided into periods and a mnemonic refers to the behaviour of the animals a branch may refer to a doublehour period in the latter case it is the center of the period for instance the horse means noon or a period from am to pm rat zishi to this is the time when rats are most active in seeking food rats also have a different number of digits on front and hind legs thus earning rat the symbol of turn over or new start ox choushi to this is the time when oxen begin to chew the cud slowly and comfortably tiger yinshi to this is the time when tigers hunt their prey more and show their ferocity rabbit maoshi to this is the time when the jade rabbit is busy pounding herbal medicine on the moon according to the tale dragon chenshi to this is the time when dragons are hovering in

horses are still standing goat weishi to this is the time when goats eat grass and urinate frequently monkey shenshi to this is the time when monkeys are lively rooster youshi to this is the time when roosters begin to get back to their coops dog xushi to this is the time when dogs carry out their duty of guarding the houses pig haishi to this is the time when pigs are sleeping sweetly the great race edit an ancient folk story tells that cat and rat were the worst swimmers in the animal kingdom although they were poor swimmers they were both quite intelligent to get to the meeting called by the jade emperor they had to cross a river to reach the meeting place the jade emperor had also decreed that the years on the calendar would be named for each animal in the order they arrived to the meeting cat and rat decided that the best and fastest way to cross the river was to hop on the back of ox ox being naive and goodnatured agreed to carry them both across midway across the river rat pushed cat into the water then as ox neared the other side of the river rat jumped ahead and reached the shore first so he claimed first place in the competition and the zodiac following closely behind was strong ox who was named the nd animal in the zodiac after ox came tiger panting while explaining to the jade emperor how difficult it was to cross the river with the heavy currents pushing it downstream all the time but with its powerful strength tiger made to shore and was named the rd animal in the cycle suddenly from a distance came a thumping sound and the rabbit arrived it explained how it crossed the river by jumping from one stone to another in a nimble fashion halfway through it almost lost the race but the rabbit was lucky enough to grab hold of a floating log that later washed him to shore for that it became the th animal in the zodiac cycle in th place was the flying dragon of course the jade emperor was deeply curious as to why a swift flying creature such as the dragon should fail to reach first place the mighty dragon explained that he had to stop and make rain to help all the people and creatures of the earth and therefore he was held back then on his way to the finish he saw a little helpless rabbit clinging onto a log so he did a good deed and gave a puff of breath to the poor creature so that it could land on the shore the jade emperor was very pleased with the actions of the dragon and he was added into the zodiac cycle as soon as he had done so a galloping sound was heard and the horse appeared hidden on the horses hoof was the snake whose sudden appearance gave the horse a fright thus making it fall back and giving the snake the th spot while the horse placed th not long after that a little distance away the goat monkey and rooster came to the shore these three creatures helped each other to get to where they are the rooster spotted a raft and took the other two animals with it together the goat and the monkey cleared the weeds tugged and pulled and finally got the raft to the shore because of their combined efforts the emperor was very pleased and promptly named the goat as the th creature the monkey as the th and the rooster the th the th animal was the dog although he was supposed to be the best swimmer he could not resist the temptation to play a little longer in the river though his explanation for being late was because he needed a good bath after a long spell for that he almost didnt make it to the finish line just as the jade emperor was about to call it a day an oink and squeal was heard from a little pig the pig got hungry during the race promptly stopped for a feast and then fell asleep after the nap the pig continued the race and was named the th animal of the zodiac cycle the cat drowned in th place and did not make it in the zodiac it is said that that is the reason why cats always chase rats to get back at them for what they have done another folk story tells that on registration day the rat met up with the ox he thought to himself ox is the fastest strongest animal so the little rat played a trick on the ox he asked the ox if he would like to listen to him sing the rat opened his mouth but said nothing how was that he asked the ox and of course he replied sorry little rat i didnt hear you the rat told the ox to let him jump onto his back so that he could sing it more clearly and the ox agreed soon without knowing the ox was walking to the signing post forgetting the rat on his back when they reached there the rat jumped off and claimed first place the ox following and the rest in buddhism legend has it that buddha summoned all of the animals of the earth to come before him before his departure from this earth but only animals actually came to bid him farewell to reward the animals who came to him he named a year after each of them the years were given to them in the order they had arrived the animals for the chinese zodiac must have been developed in the early stage of chinese civilization for hundreds of years until it become the current edition and its very hard to investigate the real origin most historians agree that cat is not in the list since the animals of the chinese zodiac were formed before cats were introduced to china from india with buddhism another story tells that god called the animals to a banquet that night the rat who loved to play tricks on his neighbour told the cat that the banquet was on the day after tomorrow the cat believed his neighbour the rat and slept whilst dreaming of the banquet the next day the rat arrived first followed by the ox the tiger and the rest of the animals the order of the animals was decided by the order that they arrived the cat was devastated and vowed that he would always hate the rat this is why cats chase rats in folklore problems with english translation edit this section does not cite any references or sources please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged and removed january due to confusion with synonyms during translation some of the animals depicted by the english words did not exist in ancient china for example can mean ram sheep or goat similarly rat can also be translated as mouse as there are no distinctive words for the two genera in chinese further pig is sometimes translated to boar after its japanese name and plainly means cow or ox and not water buffalo rooster may mean chicken hen or cock however rooster is the most commonly used one among all the synonyms same for etc chinese zodiac in other countries edit the chinese zodiac signs are also used by cultures other than chinese for one example they usually appear on korean new year and japanese new year s cards and stamps the united states postal

silver maple leaf coins as well as varieties from australia korea and mongolia the chinese zodiac is an internationally popular theme available from many of the worlds government and private mints the chinese zodiac is also used in some other asian countries that have been under the cultural influence of china however some of the animals in the zodiac may differ by country east asia edit the korean zodiac is identical to the chinese one the vietnamese zodiac is almost identical to the chinese zodiac except the second animal is the water buffalo instead of the ox and the fourth animal is the cat instead of the rabbit the japanese zodiac includes the mouse instead of the rat the wild boar instead of the pig and the sheep instead of the goat the japanese have since celebrated the beginning of the new year on january as per the gregorian calendar the thai zodiac includes a naga in place of the dragon and begins not at chinese new year but either on the first day of fifth month in thai lunar calendar or during the songkran festival now celebrated every april depending on the purpose of the use bulgars huns and turkic people edit the european huns used the chinese zodiac complete with

homeric greek means pure fresh air or clear sky in greek mythology it was thought to be the pure essence that the gods breathed filling the space where they lived analogous to the air breathed by mortals citation needed it is also personified as a deity aether the son of erebus and nyx in traditional greek mythology citation needed aether is related to to incinerate and intransitive to burn to shine related is the name aithiopes ethiopians see aethiopia meaning people with a burnt black visage verification needed see also empyrean fifth element edit medieval concept of the cosmos the innermost spheres are the terrestrial spheres while the outer are made of aether and contain the celestial bodies in plato s timaeus d speaking about air plato mentions that there is the most translucent kind which is called by the name of aether but otherwise he adopted the classical system of four elements aristotle who had been plato s student at the akademia agreed on this point with his former mentor emphasizing additionally that fire sometimes has been mistaken for aither however in his book on the heavens he introduced a new first element to the system of the classical elements of ionian philosophy he noted that the four terrestrial classical elements were subject to change and naturally moved linearly the first element however located in the celestial regions and heavenly bodies moved circularly and had none of the qualities the terrestrial classical elements had it was neither hot nor cold neither wet nor dry with this addition the system of elements was extended to five and later commentators started referring to the new first one as the fifth and also called it aether a word that aristotle had not used aether did not follow aristotelian physics either aether was also incapable of motion of quality or motion of quantity aether was only capable of local motion aether naturally moved in circles and had no contrary or unnatural motion aristotle also noted that crystalline spheres made of aether held the celestial bodies the idea of crystalline spheres and natural circular motion of aether led to aristotle s explanation of the observed orbits of stars and planets in perfectly circular motion in crystalline aether citation needed medieval scholastic philosophers granted aether changes of density in which the bodies of the planets were considered to be more dense than the medium which filled the rest of the universe robert fludd stated that the aether was of the character that it was subtler than light fludd cites the rdcentury view of plotinus concerning the aether as penetrative and nonmaterial see also arche quintessence edit quintessence is the latinate name of the fifth element used by medieval alchemists for a medium similar or identical to that thought to make up the heavenly bodies it was noted that there was very little presence of quintessence within the terrestrial sphere due to the low presence of quintessence earth could be affected by what takes place within the heavenly bodies this theory was developed in the th century text the testament of lullius attributed to raymond lull the use of quintessence became popular within medieval alchemy quintessence stemmed from the medieval elemental system which consisted of the four classical elements and aether or quintessence in addition to two chemical elements representing metals sulphur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties this elemental system spread rapidly throughout all of europe and became popular with alchemists especially in medicinal alchemy medicinal alchemy then sought to isolate quintessence and incorporate it within medicine and elixirs due to quintessences pure and heavenly quality it was thought that through consumption one may rid oneself of any impurities or illnesses in the book of quintessence a thcentury english translation of a continental text quintessence was used as a medicine for many of mans illnesses a process given for the creation of quintessence is distillation of alcohol seven times over the years the term quintessence has become synonymous with elixirs medicinal alchemy and the philosophers stone itself legacy edit main article aether theories with the th century physics developments physical models known as aether theories made use of a similar concept for the explanation of the propagation of electromagnetic and gravitational forces as early as the s newton used the idea of aether to help match observations to strict mechanical rules of his physics however the early modern aether had little in common with the aether of classical elements from which the name was borrowed these aether theories are considered to be scientifically obsolete as the development of special relativity showed that maxwells equations do not require the aether for the transmission of these forces however einstein himself noted that his own model which replaced these theories could itself be thought of as an aether as it implied that the empty space between objects had its own physical properties despite the early modern aether models being superseded by general relativity occasionally some physicists have attempted to reintroduce the concept of aether in an attempt to address perceived deficiencies in current physical models one proposed model of dark energy has been named quintessence by its proponents in honor of the classical element this idea relates to the hypothecial form of dark energy postulated as an explanation of observations of an accelerating universe it has also been called a fifth fundamental force this quintessence however differs from the cosmological constant in that it is changing over time unlike the constant and unchanging quintessence of the medieval and ancient greek period citation needed aether and light edit the motion of light was a longstanding investigation in physics for hundreds of years before the th century the use of aether to describe this motion was popular during the th and th centuries including a theory proposed by the less wellknown johann bernoulli who was recognized in with the prize of the french academy in his theory all space is permeated by aether containing excessively small whirlpools these whirlpools allow for aether to have a certain elasticity transmitting vibrations from the corpuscular packets of light as they travel through this theory of luminiferous aether would influence the wave theory of light proposed by christiaan huygens in which light traveled in the form of longitudinal waves via an omnipresent perfectly elastic medium having zero density called aether at the time it was thought that in order for light to travel through a vacuum there must have been a medium filling the void through which it could propagate as sound through air or ripples in a pool later when it was proved that the nature of light wave is transverse instead of longitudinal huygens theory was replaced by subsequent theories proposed by maxwell einstein and de broglie which rejected the existence and necessity of aether to explain the various optical phenomena these theories were supported by the results of the michelsonmorley experiment in which evidence for the presence of aether was conclusively absent the results of the experiment influenced many physicists of the time and contributed to the eventual development of einsteins theory of special relativity aether and gravitation edit sir isaac newton aether has been used in various gravitational theories as a medium to help explain gravitation and what causes it it was used in one of sir isaac newton s first published theories of gravitation philosophi naturalis principia mathematica the principia he based the whole description of planetary motions on a theoretical law of dynamic interactions he renounced standing attempts at accounting for this particular form of interaction between distant bodies by introducing a mechanism of propagation through an intervening medium he calls this intervening medium aether in his aether model newton describes aether as a medium that flows continually downward toward the earths surface and is partially absorbed and partially diffused this circulation of aether is what he associated the force of gravity with to help explain the action of gravity in a nonmechanical fashion this theory described different aether densities creating an aether density gradient his theory also explains that aether was dense within objects and rare without them as particles of denser aether interacted with the rare aether they were attracted back to the dense aether much like cooling vapors of water are attracted back to each other to form water in the principia he attempts to explain the elasticity and movement of aether by relating aether to his static model of fluids this elastic interaction is what caused the pull of gravity to take place according to this early theory and allowed an explanation for action at a distance instead of action through direct contact newton also explained this changing rarity and density of aether in his letter to robert boyle in he illustrated aether and its field around objects in this letter as well and used this as a way to inform robert boyle about his theory citation needed although newton eventually changed his theory of gravitation to one involving force and the laws of motion his starting point for the modern understanding

smaller corners are cut off we get a polyhedron with six octagonal faces and eight triangular ones in particular we can get regular octagons truncated cube the rhombicuboctahedron is obtained by cutting off both corners and edges to the correct amount a cube can be inscribed in a dodecahedron so that each vertex of the cube is a vertex of the dodecahedron and each edge is a diagonal of one of the dodecahedrons faces taking all such cubes gives rise to the regular compound of five cubes if two opposite corners of a cube are truncated at the depth of the three vertices directly connected to

history edit see also list of tour de france general classification winners origins edit the tour de france was created in the roots of the tour de france trace to the emergence of two rival sports newspapers in the country on the one hand was le velo the first and the largest daily sports newspaper in france which sold copies a day on the other was lauto which had been setup by journalists and businesspeople including comte julesalbert de dion adolphe clement and edouard michelin in the rival paper emerged following disagreements over the dreyfus affair a cause celebre in which de dion was implicated that divided france at the end of the th century over the innocence of alfred dreyfus a french army officer convictedthough later exoneratedof selling military secrets to the germans n the new newspaper appointed henri desgrange as the editor he was a prominent cyclist and owner with victor goddet of the velodrome at the parc des princes de dion knew him through his cycling reputation through the books and cycling articles that he had written and through press articles he had written for the clement tyre company lauto was not the success its backers wanted stagnating sales lower than the rival it was intended to surpass led to a crisis meeting on november on the middle floor of lauto s office at rue du faubourg montmartre paris the last to speak was the most junior there the chief cycling journalist a yearold named geo lefevre desgrange had poached him from giffards paper lefevre suggested a sixday race of the sort popular on the track but all around france longdistance cycle races were a popular means to sell more newspapers but nothing of the length that lefevre suggested had been attempted n if it succeeded it would help lauto match its rival and perhaps put it out of business it could as desgrange said nail giffards beak shut desgrange and lefevre discussed it after lunch desgrange was doubtful but the papers financial director victor goddet was enthusiastic he handed desgrange the keys to the company safe and said take whatever you need lauto announced the race on january the first tour de france edit main article tour de france maurice garin winner of the first tour de france standing on the right the man on the left is possibly leon georget the first tour de france was staged in the plan was a fivestage race from may to july starting in paris and stopping in lyon marseille bordeaux and nantes before returning to paris toulouse was added later to break the long haul across southern france from the mediterranean to the atlantic stages would go through the night and finish next afternoon with rest days before riders set off again but this proved too daunting and the costs too great for most and only competitors had entered desgrange had never been wholly convinced and he came close to dropping the idea instead he cut the length to days changed the dates to to july and offered a daily allowance to those who averaged at least kmh on all the stages equivalent to what a rider would have expected to earn each day had he worked in a factory he also cut the entry fee from to francs and set the first prize at francs and the prize for each days winner at francs the winner would thereby win six times what most workers earned in a year that attracted between and entrants the higher number may have included serious inquiries and some who dropped out among them not just professionals but amateurs some unemployed some simply adventurous desgrange seems not to have forgotten the dreyfus affair that launched his race and raised the passions of his backers he announced his new race on july by citing the writer emile zola whose open letter in which every paragraph started jaccuse led to dreyfuss acquittal establishing the florid style he used henceforth the first tour de france started almost outside the cafe reveilmatin at the junction of the melun and corbeil roads in the village of montgeron it was waved away by the starter georges abran at pm on july lauto hadnt featured the race on its front page that morning n among the competitors were the eventual winner maurice garin his wellbuilt rival hippolyte aucouturier the german favourite josef fischer and a collection of adventurers including one competing as samson n the race finished on the edge of paris at ville davray outside the restaurant du pere auto before a ceremonial ride into paris and several laps of the parc des princes garin dominated the race winning the first and last two stages at kmh the last rider millocheau finished h m s behind him edit such was the passion that the first tour created in spectators and riders that desgrange said the tour de france would be the last cheating was rife and riders were beaten up by rival fans as they neared the top of the col de la republique sometimes called the col du grand bois outside stetienne the leading riders including the winner maurice garin were disqualified though it took the union velocipedique de france until november to make the decision mcgann says the uvf waited so long well aware of the passions aroused by the race desgranges opinion of the fighting and cheating showed in the headline of his reaction in lauto the end desgranges despair did not last by the following spring he was planning another tour longer at stages rather than and this time all in daylight to make any cheating more obvious stages in began between am and am the race captured the imagination lautos circulation rose from to by it was a quarter of a million the tour returned after its suspension during world war one and continued to grow with circulation of lauto reaching by the record claimed by desgrange was during the tour le velo meanwhile went out of business in desgrange and his tour invented bicycle stage racing desgrange experimented with different ways of judging the winner initially he used total accumulated time as used in the modern tour de france but from to by points for placings each day n desgrange saw problems in judging both by time and by points by time a rider coping with a mechanical problemwhich the rules insisted he repair alonecould lose so much time that it cost him the race equally riders could finish so separated that time gained or lost on one or two days could decide the whole race judging the race by points removed overinfluential time differences but discouraged competitors from riding hard it made no difference whether they finished fast or slow or separated by seconds or hours so they were inclined to ride together at a relaxed pace until close to the line only then disputing the final placings that would give them points the format changed over time the tour originally ran around the perimeter of france cycling was an endurance sport and the organisers realised the sales they would achieve by creating supermen of the competitors night riding was dropped after the second tour in when there had been persistent cheating when judges could not see riders that reduced the daily and overall distance but the emphasis remained on endurance desgrange said his ideal race would be so hard that only one rider would make it to paris the first mountain stages in the pyrenees appeared in early tours had long multiday stages with the format settling on stages from until after this stages were gradually shortened such that by there were as many as three stages in a single day desgrange initially preferred to see the tour as a race of individuals the first tours were open to whoever wanted to compete most riders were in teams that looked after them the private entrants were called touristeroutiers tourists of the road from and were allowed to take part provided they make no demands on the organisers some of the tours most colourful characters have been touristeroutiers one finished each days race and then performed acrobatic tricks in the street to raise the price of a hotel until desgrange forbade team members from pacing each other the and tours however consisted mainly of team timetrials an unsuccessful experiment which sought to avoid a proliferation of sprint finishes on flat stages desgrange was a traditionalist with equipment until he demanded that riders mend their bicycles without help and that they use the same bicycle from start to end exchanging a damaged bicycle for another was allowed only in desgrange stood against the use of multiple gears and for many years insisted riders use wooden rims fearing the heat of braking while coming down mountains would melt the glue that held the tires on metal rims they were finally allowed in by the end of the s desgrange believed he could not beat what he believed were the underhand tactics of bike factories when the alcyon team contrived to get maurice de waele to win even though he was sick he said my race has been won by a corpse in desgrange again attempted to take control of the tour from teams insisting competitors enter in national teams rather than trade teams and that competitors ride plain yellow bicycles that he would provide without a makers name there was no place for individuals in the posts teams and so desgrange created regional teams generally from france to take in riders who would not otherwise have qualified the original touristeroutiers mostly disappeared but some were absorbed into regional teams in desgrange had a prostate operation at the time two operations were needed the tour de france was due to fall between them desgrange persuaded his surgeon to let him follow the race the second day proved too much and in a fever at charleville he retired to his chateau at beauvallon desgrange died at home on the mediterranean coast on august the race was taken over by his deputy jacques goddet the tour was again disrupted by war after and did not return until edit jacques goddet memorial at the top of the col du tourmalet in lauto was closed its doors nailed shut and its belongings including the tour sequestrated by the state for publishing articles too close to the germans rights to the tour were therefore owned by the government jacques goddet was allowed to publish another daily sports paper lequipe but there was a rival candidate to run the tour a consortium of sports and miroir sprint each organised a candidate race lequipe and le parisien libere had la course du tour de france and sports and miroir sprint had la ronde de france both were five stages the longest the government would allow because of shortages lequipe s race was better organised and appealed more to the public because it featured national teams that had been successful before the war when french cycling was at a high lequipe was given the right to organise the tour de france however lequipe s finances were never sound and goddet accepted an advance by emilion amaury who had supported his bid to run the postwar tour amaury was a newspaper magnate whose condition was that his sports editor felix levitan should join goddet for the tour the two worked together goddet running the sporting side and levitan the financial on the tours return the format of the race settled on between stages most stages would last one day but the scheduling of split stages continued well in to the s saw the introduction of the green jersey points competition national teams contested the tour until the teams were of different sizes some nations had more than one team and some were mixed in with others to make up the number national teams caught the public imagination but had a snag that riders might normally have been in rival trade teams the rest of the season the loyalty of riders was sometimes questionable within and between teams sponsors were always unhappy about releasing their riders into anonymity for the biggest race of the year as riders in national teams wore the colours of their country and a small cloth panel on their chest that named the team for which they normally rode the situation became critical at the start of the s sales of bicycles had fallen and bicycle factories were closing there was a risk the trade said that the industry would die if factories were not allowed the publicity of the tour de france the tour returned to trade teams in although with further problems doping had become a problem culminating in the death of tom simpson in after which riders went on strike though the organisers suspected sponsors provoked them the union cycliste internationale introduced limits to daily and overall distances imposed rest days and tests were introduced for riders it was then impossible to follow the frontiers and the tour increasingly zigzagged across the country sometimes with unconnected days races linked by train while still maintaining some sort of loop the tour returned to national teams for and as an experiment the tour returned to trade teams in with a suggestion that national teams could come back every few years this never happened edit in the early s the race was dominated by eddy merckx who won the general classifcaition five times the mountains classification twice the points classification three times and a record stages during this era race director felix levitan brought in a new commercial era of the tour beginning to recruit sponsors sometimes accepting prizes in kind if he could not get cash he introduced the finish of the tour at the avenue des champselysees in the same year the polkadot jersey in the colors of a sponsoring chocolate company was introduced for the winner of the mountains classification he helped drive an internationalization of the tour de france and cycling in general in sean kelly of ireland points and phil anderson of australia young rider became the first winners of any tour classifications from outside cyclings continental europe heartlands while levitan was influential in facilitating the participation in the tour de france by amateur riders from the eastern bloc and colombia greg lemond of the usa became the first noneuropean winner in the race while the global awareness and popularity of the tour grew during this time its finances became stretched goddet and levitan continued to clash over the running of the race levitan launched the tour of america as a precursor to his plans to take the tour de france to the usa the tour of america lost a lot of money and it appeared to have been crossfinanced by the tour de france levitan insisted he was innocent but he was fired from the tour in march goddet retired the following year present edit this section requires expansion july in the tour was organsied by jeanpierre courcol the director of lequipe then in by jeanpierre carenso and then by jeanmarie leblanc who in had been race director the former television presenter christian prudhomme he commentated on the tour among other events replaced leblanc in having been assistant director for three years in ownership of lequipe moved to the amaury group which formed amaury sport organisation aso to oversee its sports operations although the tour itself is operated by its subsidiary the societe du tour de france aso employs around people fulltime in an office facing but not connected to lequipe in the issylesmoulineaux area of outer western paris that number expands to about during the race itself not

and main competition in the tour de france is known as the general classification for which the yellow jersey is awarded the winner of this is said to have won the race a few riders from each team aim to win overall but there are three further competitions to draw riders of all specialties points mountains and a classification for young riders with general classification aspirations the leader of

winning the race the oldest and most sought after classification in the tour de france is the general classification all of the stages are timed to the finish the riders times are compounded with their previous stage times so the rider with the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the race the leader is determined after each stages conclusion the leader of the race also has the privilege to wear the race leaders yellow jersey the jersey is presented to the leader rider on a podium in the stages finishing town if a rider is leading more than one classification that awards a jersey he will wear the maillot jaune since the general classification is the most important one in the race the lead can change after each stage between and inclusive in response to concerns about rider cheating in the race the general classification was awarded according to a point based system based on their placings in each stage and the rider with the lowest total of points after the tours conclusion was the winner the leader in the first tour de france was awarded a yellow armband the color yellow was chosen as the magazine that created the tour lauto printed its newspapers on yellow paper the yellow jersey was added to the race in the edition and it has since become a symbol of the tour de france the first rider to wear the yellow jersey was eugene christophe each team brings multiple yellow jerseys in advance of the tour in case one of their riders becomes the overall leader of the race riders usually try to make the extra effort to keep the jersey for as long as possible in order to get more publicity for the team and the sponsors of the team eddy merckx has worn the yellow jersey for stages which is more than any other rider in the history of the tour de france four riders have won the general classification five times in their career jacques anquetil eddy merckx bernard hinault and miguel indurain mountains classification edit main article mountains classification in the tour de france richard virenque pictured at the tour de france wearing the polka dot jersey he won the mountains classification a record seven times the mountains classification is the second oldest jersey awarding classification in the tour de france the mountains classification was added to the tour de france in the edition and was first won by vicente trueba prizes for the classification were first awarded in during stages of the race containing climbs points are awarded to the first riders to reach the top of each categorized climb with points available for up to the first riders depending on the classification of the climb climbs are classified according to the steepness and length of that particular hill with more points available for harder climbs the classification was preceded by the meilleur grimpeur english best climber which was awarded by the organising newspaper lauto to a cyclist who completed each race the classification awarded no jersey to the leader until the tour de france when the organizers decided to award a distinctive white jersey with red dots to the leader the climbers jersey is worn by the rider who at the start of each stage has the largest amount of climbing points if a rider leads two or more of classifications the climbers jersey is worn by the rider in second or third place in that contest at the end of the tour the rider holding the most climbing points wins the classification some riders may race with the aim of winning this particular competition while others who gain points early on may shift their focus to the classification during the race the tour has five categories for ranking the mountains the race covers the scale ranges from category the easiest to hors categorie the hardest during his career richard virenque won the mountains classification a record seven times the point distribution for the mountains is as follows type st nd rd th th th th th th th hors categorie first category second category third category fourth category points awarded are doubled for finishes that are of category two or above points classification edit main article points classification in the tour de france alessandro petacchi in the

was added to draw the participation of the sprinters as well as celebrate the th anniversary of the tour points are given to the first riders to finish a stage with an additional set of points given to the first riders to cross a predetermined sprint point during the route of each stage the point classification leader green jersey is worn by the rider who at the start of each stage has the greatest number of points in the first years the cyclist received penalty points for not finishing with a high place so the cyclist with the fewest points was awarded the green jersey from on the system was changed so the cyclists were awarded points for high place finishes with first place getting the most points and lower placings getting successively fewer points so the cyclist with the most points was awarded the green jersey the amount of points awarded varies depending on the type of stage with flat stages awarding the most points at the finish and time trials and high mountain stages awarding the least amount of points at the finish this increases the likelihood of a sprinter winning the points classification though other riders can be competitive for the classification if they have a sufficient number of highplace finishes the winner of the classification is the rider with the most points at the end of the tour in case of a tie the leader is determined by the number of stage wins then the number of intermediate sprint victories and finally the riders standing in the general classification the classification has been won a record six times by erik zabel the most recent winner peter sagan won it in and the first year the points classification was used it was sponsored by la belle jardiniere a lawn mower producer and the jersey was made green in the jersey was

leading team has worn numbers printed blackonyellow until the leading team would wear yellow caps as of the riders of the leading team wear yellow helmets during the era of national teams france and belgium won times each from up to there was also a team classification based on points stage classification members of the leading team would wear green caps historical classifications edit there has been an intermediate sprints classification which from awarded a red jersey for points awarded to the first three to pass intermediate points during the stage these sprints also scored points towards the points classification and bonuses towards the general classification the intermediate sprints classification with its red jersey was abolished in but the intermediate sprints have remained offering points for the points classification and until time bonuses for the general classification from there was a combination classification scored on a points system based on standings in the general points and mountains classifications the design was originally white then a patchwork with areas resembling each individual jersey design this was also abolished in lanterne rouge edit the rider who has taken most time is called the lanterne rouge red lantern as in the red light at the back of a vehicle so it can be seen in the dark and in past years sometimes carried a small red light beneath his saddle such was sympathy that he could command higher fees in the races that previously followed the tour in and the organisers excluded the last rider every day to encourage more competitive racing n prizes edit prize money in euros in the tour de france not corrected for inflation prize money has always been awarded from old francs the first year prize money has increased each year although from to the first prize was an apartment offered by a race sponsor the first prize in was a car a studioapartment a work of art and francs in cash prizes only in cash returned in prizes and bonuses are awarded for daily placings and final placings at the end of the race in the winner received while each of the stage winners won for the team timetrial stage the winners of the points classification and mountains classification each win the young rider competition and the combativity prize and for the winner of the team classification calculated by adding the cumulative times of the best three riders in each team the souvenir henri desgrange in memory of the founder of the tour is awarded to the first rider over the col du galibier where his monument stands or to the first rider over the highest col in the tour a similar award is made at the summit of the col du tourmalet at the memorial to jacques goddet desgranges successor stages edit the modern tour typically has stages one per day massstart stages edit a collected peloton in the tour de france riders in most stages start together the first kilometres the depart fictif are a rolling start without racing the real start the depart reel is announced by the tour director waving a white flag riders are permitted to touch but not push or nudge each other the first to cross the stage finish line wins the stage riders are given a time based on the group that they finish in all riders in a group finish in the same time as the lead rider this avoids dangerous mass sprints it is not unusual for the entire field to finish in a group taking time to cross the line but being credited with the same time since when riders fall or crash within the final kilometres of a stage with a flat finish they are awarded the same time as the group they were in this change encourages riders to sprint to the finish for points awards without fear of losing time to the group the final kilometre has been indicated since by a red triangle the flamme rouge above the road the first photofinish was in the tour directors categorize massstage starts into flat hilly or mountain this affects the points awarded in the sprint classification whether the kilometer rule is operational and the permitted disqualification time in which riders must finish which is the winners time plus a predetermined percentage of that time time bonuses of and seconds are awarded to the the first three finishers though this was not done from bonuses were previously also awarded to winners of intermediate sprints on flat stages most riders can stay in the peloton to the finish and sprint finishes are common crosswinds the difficulty of long cobbled sections or crashes are often the major challenges of these stages on hilly and particularly mountain stages there can be major shifts in the general classification particularly where stages finish at the tops of climbs it is not uncommon for riders to lose minutes or to be eliminated after finishing outside the time limit individual time trials edit bradley wiggins riding the stage individual time trial of the tour de france riders in a time trial compete individually against the clock each starting at a different time the first time trial was between la rochesuryon and nantes km in the first stage in modern tours is often a short trial a prologue to decide who wears yellow on the opening day the first prologue was in the event at la baule was called la preface there are usually two or three time trials the final time trial has sometimes been the final stage more recently often the penultimate stage the launch ramp a sloping start pad for riders was first used in at cologne team time trial edit a team time trial ttt is a race against the clock in which each team rides alone the time is that of the fifth rider of each team riders more than a bikelength behind their teams fifth rider are awarded their own times the ttt has been criticised for favouring strong teams and handicapping strong riders in weak teams the prologue stage in was a team time trial time limits edit riders completing a stage may be eliminated if their time exceeds the time limit for the stage the limit is defined as the winners time plus a percentage which depends on the type of stage and the winners average speed the time limit can be extended or the elimination can be waived if more than of riders exceed the limit or for other reasons such as collisions or foul weather for example for a stage classed as coefficient stages with no particular difficulty the time limit is the winners time plus for an average speed of up to kmh increasing in steps to for a speed of over kmh while on a coefficient very difficult short stages it varies from up to kmh to over kmh notable stages edit altitude profile of the alpe dhuez climb the race has finished since with laps of the champselysees this stage rarely challenges the leader because it is flat and the leader usually has too much time in hand to be denied but in pedro delgado broke away on the champs to challenge the second lead held by stephen roche he and roche finished in the peloton and roche won the tour in modern times there tends to be a gentlemens agreement while the points classification is still contended if possible the overall classification is not fought over because of this it is not uncommon for the de facto winner of the overall classification to ride into paris holding a glass of champagne in the last stage was a time trial greg lemond overtook laurent fignon to win by eight seconds the closest margin in the tours history the climb of alpe dhuez is a favourite providing either a massstart or individual time trial stage in most tours during the tour de france for example alpe dhuez was the scene of an epic km mountain time trial on the th stage while the tv spectacle was overwhelming the riders complained of abusive spectators who threatened their progress up the climb and the timetrial on this stage may not be repeated mont ventoux is often claimed to be the hardest in the tour because of the harsh conditions another notable mountain stage frequently featured climbs the col du tourmalet the most visited mountain in the history of the tour col du galibier is the most visited mountain in the alps the tour de france stage to galibier marked the th anniversary of the mountain in the tour and also boasted the highest finish altitude ever m some mountain stages have become memorable because of the weather an example is a stage in tour de france from valdisere to sestriere a snowstorm at the start area led to a shortening of the stage from to just km to host a stage start or finish brings prestige and business to a town the prologue and first stage are particularly prestigious usually one town will host the prologue too short to go between towns and the start of stage in director christian prudhomme said that in general for a period of five years we have the tour start outside france three times and within france twice advertising caravan edit vehicles from the tour de france publicity caravan when switching to the use of national teams in the costs of accommodating riders fell to the organizers instead of the sponsors and henri desgrange raised the money by allowing advertisers to precede the race the procession of often colourfully decorated trucks and cars became known as the publicity caravan it formalised an existing situation companies having started to follow the race the first to sign to precede the tour was the chocolate company menier one of those who had followed the race its head of publicity paul thevenin had first put the idea to desgrange it paid old francs preceding the race was more attractive to advertisers because spectators gathered by the road long before the race or could be attracted from their houses advertisers following the race found that many who had watched the race had already gone home menier handed out tons of chocolate in that first year of preceding the race as well as policemens hats printed with the companys name the success led to the caravans existence being formalised the following year the caravan was at its height between and the mids before television and especially television advertising was established in france advertisers competed to attract public attention motorcycle acrobats performed for the cinzano aperitif company and a toothpaste maker and an accordionist yvette horner became one of the most popular sights as she performed on the roof of a citroen traction avant the modern tour restricts the excesses to which advertisers are allowed to go but at first anything was allowed the writer pierre bost n lamented this caravan of gaudy trucks singing across the countryside the virtues of an aperitif a make of underpants or a dustbin is a shameful spectacle it bellows it plays ugly music its sad its ugly it smells of vulgarity and money advertisers pay the societe du tour de france approximately to place three vehicles in the caravan some have more on top of that come the more considerable costs of the commercial samples that are thrown to the crowd and the cost of accommodating the drivers and the stafffrequently studentswho throw them the number of items has been estimated at million each person in the procession giving out to items a day a bank gan gave out caps badges plastic bags and copies of its race newspaper in together they weighed tons the vehicles also have to be decorated on the morning of each stage and because they must return to ordinary highway standards disassembled after each stage numbers vary but there are normally around vehicles each year their order on the road is established by contract the leading vehicles belonging to the largest sponsors the procession sets off two hours before the start and then regroups to precede the riders by an hour and a half it spreads km and takes minutes to pass at between and kmh vehicles travel in groups of five their position is logged by gps and from an aircraft and organised on the road by the caravan directorjeanpierre lachaud n an assistant three motorcyclists two radio technicians and a breakdown and medical crew six motorcyclists from the garde republicaine the elite of the gendarmerie ride with them politics edit the first three tours stayed within france the race went into alsacelorraine territory annexed by the german empire in after the francoprussian war passage was secured through a meeting at metz between desgranges collaborator alphonse steines and the german governor no teams from italy germany or spain rode in because of tensions preceding the second world war after german assistance to franco in the spanish civil war it was widely expected spain would join germany in a european war though this did not come to pass henri desgrange planned a tour for after war had started but before france had been invaded the route approved by military authorities included a route along the maginot line teams would have been drawn from military units in france including the british who would have been organised by a journalist bill mills then the germans invaded and the race was not held again until see tour de france during the second world war the first german team after the war was in although individual germans had ridden in mixed teams the tour has since started in germany three times in cologne in in frankfurt in and in west berlin on the citys th anniversary in plans to enter east germany that year were abandoned corsica edit prior to the tour de france had visited every region of metropolitan france except corsica jeanmarie leblanc when he was organiser said the island had never asked for a stage start there it would be difficult to find accommodation for people he said the spokesman of the corsican nationalist party party of the corsican nation francois alfonsi said the organisers must be afraid of terrorist attacks n if they are really thinking of a possible terrorist action they are wrong our movement which is nationalist and in favour of selfgovernment would be delighted if the tour came to corsica the opening three stages of the tour de france were held on corsica as part of the celebrations for the th edition of the race the start and finish of the tour edit most stages are in mainland france although since the s it has become common to visit nearby countries andorra belgium great britain germany ireland italy luxembourg monaco netherlands spain and switzerland have all hosted stages or part of a stage since the finish has been on the champselysees in paris from to the race finished at the parc des princes stadium in western paris and from to at the piste municipale south of the

newspaper and its editor desgrange saw no reason to allow rival publications to profit the first time papers other than lauto were allowed was when press cars were allowed for regional and foreign reporters the tour was shown first on cinema newsreels a day or more after the event the first live radio broadcast was in when jean antoine and alex virot of the newspaper lintransigeant broadcast for radio cite they used telephone lines in they broadcast the sound of riders crossing the col daubisque in the pyrenees on july using a recording machine and transmitting the sound later the first television pictures were shown a day after a stage the national tv channel used two mm cameras a jeep and a motorbike film was flown or taken by train to paris it was edited there and shown the following day the first live broadcast and the second of any sport in france was the finish at the parc des princes in paris on july rik van steenbergen of belgium led in the bunch after a stage of km from nancy the first live coverage from the side of the road was from the aubisque on july proposals to cover the whole race were abandoned in after objections from regional newspapers whose editors feared the competition the dispute was settled but not in time and the first complete coverage was the following year the leading television commentator in france was a former rider robert chapatte at first he was the only commentator he was joined in following seasons by an analyst for the mountain stages and by a commentator following the competitors by motorcycle broadcasting in france was largely a state monopoly until when the socialist president francois mitterrand allowed private broadcasters and privatised the leading television channel competition between channels raised the broadcasting fees paid to the organisers from per cent of the race budget in to more than a third by the end of the century broadcasting time also increased as channels competed to secure the rights the two largest channels to stay in public ownership antenne and fr combined to offer more coverage than its private rival tf the two stations renamed france and france still hold the domestic rights and provide pictures for broadcasters around the world the stations use a staff of with four helicopters two aircraft two motorcycles other vehicles including trucks and podium cameras n domestic television covers the most important stages of the tour such as those in the mountains from midmorning until early evening coverage typically starts with a survey of the days route interviews along the road discussions of the difficulties and tactics ahead and a minute archive feature the biggest stages are shown live from start to end followed by interviews with riders and others and features such an edited version of the stage seen from beside a team manager following and advising riders from his car radio covers the race in updates throughout the day particularly on the national news channel france info and some stations provide continuous commentary on long wave other countries broadcast the tour including the united states which has shown the tour since on nbcsn the combination of unprecedented rigorous doping controls and almost no positive tests helped restore fans confidence in the tour de france this led directly to an increase in global popularity of the event the most watched stage of was stage from montelimar to mont ventoux in provence with a global total audience of million making it the th most watched sporting event in the world in culture edit part of the crowd during most days of the tour is didi senft who in a red devil costume has been the tour devil since the tour is important for fans in europe millions line the route some having camped for a week to get the best view crowds flanking the course are reminiscent of the community festivals that are part of another form of cycle racing in a different country the isle of man tt the tour de france appealed from the start not just for the distance and its demands but because it played to a wish for national unity a call to what maurice barres called the france of earth and deaths or what georges vigarello called the image of a france united by its earth school book by augustine fouillee under the nom de plume g bruno the image had been started by the travelschool book le tour de la france par deux enfants n it told of two boys andre and julien who in a thick september fog left the town of phalsbourg in lorraine to see france at a time when few people had gone far beyond their nearest town the book sold six million copies by the time of the first tour de france the biggest selling book of th century france other than the bible it stimulated a national interest in france making it visible and alive as its preface said there had already been a car race called the tour de france but it was the publicity behind the cycling race and desgranges drive to educate and improve the population that inspired the french to know more of their country the academic historians jeanluc boeuf and yves leonard say most people in france had little idea of the shape of their country until lauto began publishing maps of the race arts edit the tour has inspired several popular songs in france notably ptit gars du tour les tours de france and faire le tour de france kraftwerk had a hit

held the mark for most consecutive finishes with sixteen having completed all but his very first joop zoetemelk holds the record for the most finishes having completed all of the tours that he started in the early years of the tour cyclists rode individually and were sometimes forbidden to ride together this led to large gaps between the winner and the number two since the cyclists now tend to stay together in a peloton the margins of the winner have become smaller as the difference usually originates from time trials breakaways or on mountain top finishes or from being left behind the peloton the smallest margins between the winner and the second placed cyclists at the end of the tour is s between winner greg lemond and laurent fignon in the largest margin by comparison remains that of the

would also be run largely without pacers lauto preferred to concentrate on the coupe gordonbennett car race even though it wasnt to start for another hours the choice reflects not only that the tour de france was an unknown quantity only after the first race had finished did it establish a reputation but it hints at desgranges uncertainty his position as editor depended on raising sales that would happen if the tour succeeded but the paper and his employers would lose a lot of money if it didnt desgrange preferred to keep a distance he didnt drop the flag at the start and he didnt follow the riders reporting was left to lefevre whose idea it had been who followed the race by bike and by train desgrange showed a personal interest in his race only when it looked a success the use of false and often colourful names was not unusual it reflected not only the daring of the enterprise but the slight scandal still associated with riding bicycle races enough that some preferred to use a false name the first citytocity race from paris to rouen included many madeup names or simply initials the first woman to finish had entered as miss america despite not being american the formula in

compound containing switzer an obsolete term for the swiss which was in use during the th to th centuries the english adjective swiss is a loan from french suisse also in use since the th century the name switzer is from the alemannic schwiizer in origin an inhabitant of schwyz and its associated territory one of the waldstatten cantons which formed the nucleus of the old swiss confederacy the name originates as an exonym applied pars pro toto to the troops of the confederacy the swiss began to adopt the name for themselves after the swabian war of used alongside the term for confederates eidgenossen literally comrades by oath used since the th century the toponym schwyz itself is first attested in as old high german suittes ultimately perhaps related to suedan to burn referring to the area of forest that was burned and cleared to build the name was extended to the area dominated by the canton and after the swabian war of gradually came to be used for the entire confederation the swiss german name of the country schwiiz is homophonous to that of the canton and the settlement but distinguished by the use of the definite article dschwiiz for the confederation but simply schwyz for the canton and the town the latin name confoederatio helvetica was neologized and introduced gradually after the formation of the federal state in harking back to the napoleonic helvetic republic appearing on coins from inscribed on the federal palace in and after used in the official seal the iso banking code chf for the swiss franc is taken from the states latin name helvetica is derived from the helvetii a gaulish tribe living on the swiss plateau before the roman era helvetia appears as a national personification of the swiss confederacy in the th century with a play by johann caspar weissenbach history edit main article history of switzerland switzerland has existed as a state in its present form since the adoption of the swiss federal constitution in the precursors of switzerland established a protective alliance at the end of the th century forming a loose confederation of states which persisted for centuries early history edit main articles early history of switzerland and switzerland in the roman era the oldest traces of hominid existence in switzerland date back about years the oldest known farming settlements in switzerland which were found at gachlingen have been dated to around bc founded in bc by lucius munatius plancus augusta raurica was the first roman settlement on the rhine and is now among the most important archaeological sites in switzerland the earliest known cultural tribes of the area were members of the hallstatt and la tene cultures named after the archaeological site of la tene on the north side of lake neuchatel la tene culture developed and flourished during the late iron age from around bc possibly under some influence from the greek and etruscan civilisations one of the most important tribal groups in the swiss region was the helvetii steadily harassed by the germans in bc the helvetii decided to abandon the swiss plateau and migrate to western gallia but julius caesar s armies pursued and defeated them at the battle of bibracte in todays western france forcing the tribe to move back to its original homeland in bc tiberius who was destined to be the second roman emperor and his brother drusus conquered the alps integrating them into the roman empire the area occupied by the helvetiithe namesakes of the later confoederatio helvetica first became part of romes gallia belgica province and then of its germania superior province while the eastern portion of modern switzerland was integrated into the roman province of raetia sometime around the start of the common era the romans maintained a large legionary camp called vindonissa now a ruin at the confluence of the aare and reuss rivers near the town of windisch an outskirt of brugg the first and second century ad were an age of prosperity for the population living along the swiss plateau several towns like aventicum iulia equestris and augusta raurica reached a remarkable size while hundreds of agricultural estates villae rusticae were founded in the countryside in about ad the fall of the agri decumates territory north of the rhine transformed todays switzerland into a frontier land of the empire repeated raids by the alamanni tribes provoked the ruin of the roman towns and economy forcing the population to find shelter near roman fortresses like the castrum rauracense near augusta raurica the empire built another line of defense at the north border the socalled donauillerrhinelimes but at the end of the fourth century the increased germanic pressure forced the romans to abandon the linear defence concept and the swiss plateau was finally open to the settlement of german tribes in the early middle ages from the end of the th century the western extent of modernday switzerland was part of the territory of the kings of the burgundians the alemanni settled the swiss plateau in the th century and the valleys of the alps in the th century forming alemannia modernday switzerland was therefore then divided between the kingdoms of alemannia and burgundy the entire region became part of the expanding frankish empire in the th century following clovis i s victory over the alemanni at tolbiac in ad and later frankish domination of the burgundians throughout the rest of the th th and th centuries the swiss regions continued under frankish hegemony merovingian and carolingian dynasties but after its extension under charlemagne the frankish empire was divided by the treaty of verdun in the territories of presentday switzerland became divided into middle francia and east francia until they were reunified under the holy roman empire around ad by the swiss plateau comprised the dominions of the houses of savoy zahringer habsburg and kyburg some regions uri schwyz unterwalden later known as waldstatten were accorded the imperial immediacy to grant the empire direct control over the mountain passes with the extinction of its male line in the kyburg dynasty fell in ad then the habsburgs under king rudolph i holy roman emperor in laid claim to the kyburg lands and annexed them extending their territory to the eastern swiss plateau old swiss confederacy edit main article old swiss confederacy further information growth of the old swiss confederacy reformation in switzerland and early modern switzerland the bundesbrief federal charter the old swiss confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central alps the confederacy facilitated management of common interests and ensured peace on the important mountain trade routes the federal charter of agreed between the rural communes of uri schwyz and unterwalden is considered the confederacys founding document even though similar alliances are likely to have existed decades earlier the old swiss confederacy from dark green to the sixteenth century light green and its associates blue in the other colors are shown the subject territories by the three original cantons had joined with the cantons of glarus and zug and the lucerne zurich and bern city states to form the old confederacy of eight states that existed until the end of the th century the expansion led to increased power and wealth for the federation by the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the rhine to the alps and the jura mountains particularly after victories against the habsburgs battle of sempach battle of nafels over charles the bold of burgundy during the s and the success of the swiss mercenaries the swiss victory in the swabian war against the swabian league of emperor maximilian i in amounted to de facto independence within the holy roman empire the old swiss confederacy had acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars but expansion of the federation suffered a setback in with the swiss defeat in the battle of marignano this ended the socalled heroic epoch of swiss history the success of zwingli s reformation in some cantons led to intercantonal religious conflicts in and wars of kappel it was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that in under the peace of westphalia european countries recognized switzerlands independence from the holy roman empire and its neutrality during the early modern period of swiss history the growing authoritarianism of the patriciate families combined with a financial crisis in the wake of the thirty years war led to the swiss peasant war of in the background to this struggle the conflict between catholic and protestant cantons persisted erupting in further violence at the first war of villmergen in and the toggenburg war or second war of villmergen in napoleonic era edit main articles switzerland in the napoleonic era helvetic republic and act of mediation the act of mediation was napoleons attempt at a compromise between the ancien regime and a republic in the revolutionary french government conquered switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution this centralised the government of the country effectively abolishing the cantons moreover mulhausen joined france and valtellina valley the cisalpine republic separating from switzerland the new regime known as the helvetic republic was highly unpopular it had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition making switzerland nothing more than a french satellite state the fierce french suppression of the nidwalden revolt in september was an example of the oppressive presence of the french army and the local populations resistance to the occupation when war broke out between france and its rivals russian and austrian forces invaded switzerland the swiss refused to fight alongside the french in the name of the helvetic republic in napoleon organised a meeting of the leading swiss politicians from both sides in paris the result was the act of mediation which largely restored swiss autonomy and introduced a confederation of cantons henceforth much of swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons tradition of selfrule with the need for a central government in the congress of vienna fully reestablished swiss independence and the european powers agreed to permanently recognise swiss neutrality swiss troops still served foreign governments until when they fought in the siege of gaeta the treaty also allowed switzerland to increase its territory with the admission of the cantons of valais neuchatel and geneva switzerlands borders have not changed since except some minor adjustments federal state edit main articles restoration and regeneration switzerland and switzerland as a federal state the first federal palace in bern one of the three cantons presiding over the tagsatzung former legislative and executive council bern was chosen as the federal capital in mainly because of its closeness to the frenchspeaking area the restoration of the power to the patriciate was only temporary after a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the zuriputsch of civil war the sonderbundskrieg broke out in when some catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance the sonderbund the war lasted for less than a month causing fewer than casualties most of which were through friendly fire however minor the sonderbundskrieg seems to be when compared with other european riots and wars in the th century it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the swiss and of switzerland the war convinced most swiss of the need for unity and strength towards its european neighbours swiss people from all strata of society whether catholic or protestant from the liberal or conservative current realised that the cantons would profit more if their economic and religious interests were merged thus while the rest of europe saw revolutionary uprisings the swiss drew up a constitution which provided for a federal layout much of it inspired by the american example this constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the cantons the right to selfgovernment on local issues giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons the sonderbund kantone the national assembly was divided between an upper house the council of states two representatives per canton and a lower house the national council with representatives elected from across the country referenda were made mandatory for any amendment of this constitution inauguration in of the gotthard rail tunnel connecting the southern canton of ticino the longest in the world at the time a system of single weights and measures was introduced and in the swiss franc became the swiss single currency article of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad though the swiss were still obliged to serve francis ii of the two sicilies with swiss guards present at the siege of gaeta in marking the end of foreign service an important clause of the constitution was that it could be rewritten completely if this was deemed necessary thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than being modified one amendment at a time this need soon proved itself when the rise in population and the industrial revolution that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly an early draft was rejected by the population in but modifications led to its acceptance in it introduced the facultative referendum for laws at the federal level it also established federal responsibility for defense trade and legal matters in the constitution was revised with unusually strong elements of direct democracy which remain unique even today modern history edit main articles switzerland during the world wars and modern history of switzerland general ulrich wille commanderinchief of the swiss army during world war i switzerland was not invaded during either of the world wars during world war i switzerland was home to vladimir illych ulyanov vladimir lenin and he remained there until swiss neutrality was seriously questioned by the grimmhoffmann affair in but it was shortlived in switzerland joined the league of nations which was based in geneva on the condition that it was exempt from any military requirements during world war ii detailed invasion plans were drawn up by the germans but switzerland was never attacked switzerland was able to remain independent through a combination of military deterrence concessions to germany and good fortune as larger events during the war delayed an invasion under general henri guisan central command a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered the swiss military strategy was changed from one of static defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland to one of organised longterm attrition and withdrawal to strong wellstockpiled positions high in the alps known as the reduit switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the axis and allied powers switzerlands trade was blockaded by both the allies and by the axis economic cooperation and extension of credit to the third reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion and the availability of other trading partners concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through vichy france was severed in leaving switzerland completely surrounded by the axis over the course of the war switzerland interned over refugees and the international red cross based in geneva played an important part during the conflict strict immigration and asylum policies as well as the financial relationships with nazi germany raised controversy but not until the end of the th century during the war the swiss air force engaged aircraft of both sides shooting down intruding luftwaffe planes in may and june then forcing down other intruders after a change of policy following threats from germany over allied bombers and their crews were interned during the war during allied bombers mistakenly bombed a few places in switzerland among which were the cities of schaffhausen basel and zurich after the war the swiss government exported credits through the charitable fund known as the schweizerspende and also donated to the marshall plan to help europes recovery efforts that ultimately benefited the swiss economy during the cold war swiss authorities considered the construction of a swiss nuclear bomb leading nuclear physicists at the federal institute of technology zurich such as paul scherrer made this a realistic possibility however financial problems with the defense budget prevented the substantial funds from being allocated and the nuclear nonproliferation treaty of was seen as a valid alternative all remaining plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by switzerland was the last western republic to grant women the right to vote with some swiss cantons approving this in and later with a federal level in and after resistance in the last canton appenzell innerrhoden one of only two remaining landsgemeinde in after suffrage at the federal level women quickly rose in political significance with the first woman on the seven member federal council executive being elisabeth kopp who served from and the first female president being ruth dreifuss in in by granting the swiss peoples party a second seat in the governing cabinet the parliament altered the coalition which had dominated swiss politics since switzerland joined the council of europe in in areas from the canton of bern attained independence from the bernese forming the new canton of jura on april the swiss population and the cantons voted in favour of a completely revised federal constitution in switzerland became a full member of the united nations leaving the vatican city as the last widely recognised state without full un membership switzerland is a founding member of the efta but is not a member of the european economic area an application for membership in the european union was sent in may but not advanced since the eea was rejected in december when switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the eea there have since been several referenda on the eu issue due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has been frozen nonetheless swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the eu and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the european union switzerland together with liechtenstein has been completely surrounded by the eu since austrias membership in on june swiss voters agreed by a majority to join the schengen treaty a result that was regarded by eu commentators as a sign of support by switzerland a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies geography edit main article geography of switzerland physical map of switzerland extending across the north and south side of the alps in west central europe switzerland encompasses a great diversity of landscapes and climates on a limited area of square kilometres sqmi the population is about million resulting in an average population density of around people per square kilometre sqmi the more mountainous southern half of the country is far more sparsely populated than the northern half in the largest canton of graubunden lying entirely in the alps population density falls to km sq mi switzerland lies between latitudes and n and longitudes and e it contains three basic topographical areas the swiss alps to the south the swiss plateau or central plateau and the jura mountains on the west the alps are a high mountain range running across the centralsouth of the country comprising about of the countrys total area the majority of the swiss population live in the swiss plateau among the high valleys of the swiss alps many glaciers are found totalling an area of square kilometres sqmi from these originate the headwaters of several major rivers such as the rhine inn ticino and rhone which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of europe the hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of freshwater in central and western europe among which are included lake geneva also called le lac leman in french lake constance known as bodensee in german and lake maggiore switzerland has more than lakes and contains of europes stock of fresh water lakes and glaciers cover about of the national territory the largest lake is lake geneva in western switzerland shared with france the rhone is both the main source and outflow of lake geneva lake constance is the second largest swiss lake and like the lake geneva an intermediate step by the rhine at the border to austria and germany while the rhone flows into the mediterranean sea at the french camarque region and the rhine flows into the north sea at rotterdam in the netherlands about km apart both springs are only about km apart from each other in the swiss alps contrasted landscapes between the regions of the matterhorn and lake lucerne of switzerlands mountains are metres ft above sea in altitude or higher at m ft monte rosa is the highest although the matterhorn m or ft is often regarded as the most famous both are located within the pennine alps in the canton of valais the section of the bernese alps above the deep glacial lauterbrunnen valley containing waterfalls is well known for the jungfrau m or ft eiger and monch and the many picturesque valleys in the region in the southeast the long engadin valley encompassing the st moritz area in canton of graubunden is also well known the highest peak in the neighbouring bernina alps is piz bernina m or ft the more populous northern part of the country comprising about of the countrys total area is called the swiss plateau it has greater open and hilly landscapes partly forested partly open pastures usually with grazing herds or vegetables and fruit fields but it is still hilly there are large lakes found here and the biggest swiss cities are in this area of the country climate edit the swiss climate is generally temperate but can vary greatly between the localities from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the often pleasant near mediterranean climate at switzerlands southern tip there are some valley areas in the southern part of switzerland where some coldhardy palm trees are found summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing the less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion during these periods thus seeing no sun for weeks a weather phenomenon known as the fohn with an identical effect to the chinook wind can occur at all times of the year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind bringing air of very low relative humidity to the north of the alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the alps this works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south valleys running south to north trigger the best effect the driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas large alpine areas such as graubunden remain drier than prealpine areas and as in the main valley of the valais wine grapes are grown there the wettest conditions persist in the high alps and in the ticino canton which has much sun yet heavy bursts of rain from time to time precipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout the year with a peak in summer autumn is the driest season winter receives less precipitation than summer yet the weather patterns in switzerland are not in a stable climate system and can be variable from year to year with no strict and predictable periods contrasted climates between the most glaciated area in western eurasia aletsch glacier the cold temperate jura vallee de joux the southern canton of ticino lake lugano and the western canton of vaud and its vine terraces lake geneva environment edit switzerlands ecosystems can be particularly fragile because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies the mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing the climatic geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change nevertheless according to the environmental performance index switzerland ranks first among nations in safeguarding the environment due to its high scores on environmental public health its heavy reliance on renewable sources of energy hydropower and geothermal energy and its control of greenhouse gas emissions politics edit main article politics of switzerland the swiss federal council in with president simonetta sommaruga in the front right note the federal constitution adopted in is the legal foundation of the modern federal state it is among the oldest constitutions in the world a new constitution was adopted in but did not introduce notable changes to the federal structure it outlines basic and political rights of individuals and citizen participation in public affairs divides the powers between the confederation and the cantons and defines federal jurisdiction and authority there are three main governing bodies on the federal level the bicameral parliament legislative the federal council executive and the federal court judicial the federal palace seat of the federal assembly and the federal council the swiss parliament consists of two houses the council of states which has representatives two from each canton and one from each halfcanton who are elected under a system determined by each canton and the national council which consists of members who are elected under a system of proportional representation depending on the population of each canton members of both

citizens may challenge a law passed by parliament if they gather signatures against the law within days if so a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a simple majority whether to accept or reject the law any cantons together can also call a referendum on a federal law similarly the federal constitutional initiative allows citizens to put a constitutional amendment to a national vote if voters sign the proposed amendment within months note parliament can supplement the proposed amendment with a counterproposal and then voters must indicate a preference on the ballot in case both

commercial fishing fish farms fish products fish marketing fisheries management sustainability cultural impact see also notes references further reading external links history edit stone age fish hook made from bone main articles history of fishing and history of seafood fishing is an ancient practice that dates back to at least the beginning of the paleolithic period about years ago isotopic analysis of the skeletal remains of tianyuan man a year old modern human from eastern asia has shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish archaeology features such as shell middens discarded fish bones and cave paintings show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities during this period most people lived a huntergatherer lifestyle and were of necessity constantly on the move however where there are early examples of permanent settlements though not necessarily permanently occupied such as those at lepenski vir they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food modern trawling edit the british dogger was an early type of sailing trawler from the th century but the modern fishing trawler was developed in the th century at the english fishing port of brixham by the early th century the fishermen at brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of south devon the brixham trawler that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall gaff rig which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean they were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water the great trawling fleet that built up at brixham earned the village the title of mother of deepsea fisheries painting of a brixham trawler by william adolphus knell the painting is now in the national maritime museum this revolutionary design made large scale trawling in the ocean possible for the first time resulting in a massive migration of fishermen from the ports in the south of england to villages further north such as scarborough hull grimsby harwich and yarmouth that were points of access to the large fishing grounds in the atlantic ocean the small village of grimsby grew to become the largest fishing port in the world by the mid th century an act of parliament was first obtained in which authorised the construction of new quays and dredging of the haven to make it deeper it was only in the with the tremendous expansion in the fishing industry that the grimsby dock company was formed the foundation stone for the royal dock was laid by albert the prince consort in the dock covered acres ha and was formally opened by queen victoria in as the first modern fishing port the elegant brixham trawler spread across the world influencing fishing fleets everywhere by the end of the th century there were over fishing trawlers in commission in britain with almost at grimsby these trawlers were sold to fishermen around europe including from holland and scandinavia twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the german fishing fleet further development edit the earliest steam powered fishing boats first appeared in the s and used the trawl system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets these were large boats usually feet m in length with a beam of around feet m they weighed tons and travelled at knots kmh mph the earliest purpose built fishing vessels were designed and made by david allan in leith scotland in march when he converted a drifter to steam power in he built the first screw propelled steam trawler in the world steam trawlers were introduced at grimsby and hull in the s in it was estimated that there were men on the north sea the steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until the last sailing fishing trawler was built in in grimsby trawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coalfired steam by world war i to diesel and turbines by the end of world war ii in the first powered drum was created by laurie jarelainen the drum was a circular device that was set to the side of the boat and would draw in the nets since world war ii radio navigation aids and fish finders have been widely used the first trawlers fished over the side rather than over the stern the first purpose built stern trawler was fairtry built in at aberdeen scotland the ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the super trawler as the ship pulled its nets over the stern it could lift out a much greater haul of up to tons the ship served as a basis for the expansion of super trawlers around the world in the following decades recreational fishing edit izaak walton s compleat angler published in helped popularize fly fishing as a sport woodcut by louis rhead the early evolution of fishing as recreation is not clear for example there is anecdotal evidence for fly fishing in japan however fly fishing was likely to have been a means of survival rather than recreation the earliest english essay on recreational fishing was published in by dame juliana berners the prioress of the benedictine sopwell nunnery the essay was titled treatyse of fysshynge wyth an angle and included detailed information on fishing waters the construction of rods and lines and the use of natural baits and artificial flies recreational fishing took a great leap forward after the english civil war where a newly found interest in the activity left its mark on the many books and treatises that were written on the subject at the time compleat angler was written by izaak walton in although walton continued to add to it for a quarter of a century and described the fishing in the derbyshire wye it was a celebration of the art and spirit of fishing in prose and verse a second part to the book was added by waltons friend charles cotton charles kirby designed an improved fishing hook in that remains relatively unchanged to this day he went on to invent the kirby bend a distinctive hook with an offset point still commonly used today trading card of the ustonson company an early firm specializing in fishing equipment and holder of a royal warrant from the s the th century was mainly an era of consolidation of the techniques developed in the previous century running rings began to appear along the fishing rods which gave anglers greater control over the cast line the rods themselves were also becoming increasingly sophisticated and specialized for different roles jointed rods became common from the middle of the century and bamboo came to be used for the top section of the rod giving it a much greater strength and flexibility the industry also became commercialized rods and tackle were sold at the haberdashers store after the great fire of london in artisans moved to redditch which became a centre of production of fishing related products from the s onesimus ustonson established his trading shop in and his establishment remained as a market leader for the next century he received a royal warrant and became the official supplier of fishing tackle to three successive monarchs starting with king george iv over this period he also invented the multiplying winch the commercialization of the industry came at a time of expanded interest in fishing as a recreational hobby for members of the aristocracy the impact of the industrial revolution was first felt in the manufacture of fly lines instead of anglers twisting their own lines a laborious and timeconsuming process the new textile spinning machines allowed for a variety of tapered lines to be easily manufactured and marketed british flyfishing continued to develop in the th century with the emergence of fly fishing clubs along with the appearance of several books on the subject of fly tying and fly fishing techniques by the mid to late th century expanding leisure opportunities for the middle and lower classes began to have its effect on fly fishing which steadily grew in mass appeal the expansion of the railway network in britain allowed the less affluent for the first time to take weekend trips to the seaside or to rivers for fishing richer hobbyists ventured further abroad the large rivers of norway replete with large stocks of salmon began to attract fishers from england in large numbers in the middle of the century joness guide to norway and salmonfishers pocket companion published in was written by frederic tolfrey and was a popular guide to the country technological improvements edit nottingham and scarborough reel designs modern reel design had begun in england during the latter part of the th century and the predominant model in use was known as the nottingham reel the reel was a wide drum which spooled out freely and was ideal for allowing the bait to drift along way out with the current geared multiplying reels never successfully caught on in britain but had more success in the united states where similar models were modified by george snyder of kentucky into his baitcasting reel the first americanmade design in the material used for the rod itself changed from the heavy woods native to england to lighter and more elastic varieties imported from abroad especially from south america and the west indies bamboo rods became the generally favoured option from the mid th century and several strips of the material were cut from the cane milled into shape and then glued together to form light strong hexagonal rods with a solid core that were superior to anything that preceded them george cotton and his predecessors fished their flies with long rods and light lines allowing the wind to do most of the work of getting the fly to the fish fishing became a popular recreational activity in the th century print from currier and ives tackle design began to improve from the s the introduction of new woods to the manufacture of fly rods made it possible to cast flies into the wind on silk lines instead of horse hair these lines allowed for a much greater casting distance however these early fly lines proved troublesome as they had to be coated with various dressings to make them float and needed to be taken off the reel and dried every four hours or so to prevent them from becoming waterlogged another negative consequence was that it became easy for the much longer line to get into a tangle this was called a tangle in britain and a backlash in the us this problem spurred the invention of the regulator to evenly spool the line out and prevent tangling the american charles f orvis designed and distributed a novel reel and fly design in described by reel historian jim brown as the benchmark of american reel design and the first fully modern fly reel albert illingworth st baron illingworth a textiles magnate patented the modern form of fixedspool spinning reel in when casting illingworths reel design the line was drawn off the leading edge of the spool but was restrained and rewound by a line pickup a device which orbits around the stationary spool because the line did not have to pull against a rotating spool much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels the development of inexpensive fiberglass rods synthetic fly lines and monofilament leaders in the early s that revived the popularity of fly fishing techniques edit fishermen with traditional fish traps vietnam main article fishing techniques there are many fishing techniques and tactics for catching fish the term can also be applied to methods for catching other aquatic animals such as molluscs shellfish squid octopus and edible marine invertebrates fishing techniques include hand gathering spearfishing netting angling and trapping recreational commercial and artisanal fishers use different techniques and also sometimes the same techniques recreational fishers fish for pleasure or sport while commercial fishers fish for profit artisanal fishers use traditional lowtech methods for survival in thirdworld countries and as a cultural heritage in other countries usually recreational fishers use angling methods and commercial fishers use netting methods there is an intricate link between various fishing techniques and knowledge about the fish and their behaviour including migration foraging and habitat the effective use of fishing techniques often depends on this additional knowledge some fishermen follow fishing folklores which claim that fish feeding patterns are influenced by the position of the sun and the moon tackle edit an angler on the kennet and avon canal england with his tackle main article fishing tackle fishing tackle is a general term that refers to the equipment used by fishermen when fishing almost any equipment or gear used for fishing can be called fishing tackle some examples are hooks

vessels are used in commercial artisanal and recreational fishing according to the fao in there were four million commercial fishing vessels about million of these are decked vessels with enclosed areas nearly all of these decked vessels are mechanised and of them are over tons at the other extreme twothirds million of the undecked boats are traditional craft of various types powered only by sail and oars these boats are used by artisan fishers it is difficult to estimate how many recreational fishing boats there are although the number is high the term is fluid since most recreational boats are also used for fishing from time to time unlike most commercial fishing vessels recreational fishing boats are often not dedicated just to fishing just about anything that will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat so long as a fisher periodically climbs aboard with the intent to catch a fish fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from dugout canoes kayaks rafts pontoon boats and small dinghies to runabouts cabin cruisers and cruising yachts to large hitech and luxurious big game rigs larger boats purposebuilt with recreational fishing in

subsistence fishing practices using traditional techniques such as rod and tackle arrows and harpoons throw nets and drag nets etc recreational fishing edit angling main article recreational fishing recreational and sport fishing are fishing primarily for pleasure or competition recreational fishing has conventions rules licensing restrictions and laws that limit the way in which fish may be caught typically these prohibit the use of nets and the catching of fish with hooks not in the mouth the most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod reel line hooks and any one of a wide range of baits or lures such as artificial flies the practice of catching or attempting to catch fish with a hook is generally known as angling in angling it is sometimes expected or required that fish be returned to the water catch and release recreational or sport fishermen may log their catches or participate in fishing competitions biggame fishing is fishing from boats to catch large openwater species such as tuna sharks and marlin sport fishing sometimes game fishing is recreational fishing where the primary reward is the challenge of finding and catching the fish rather than the

fish or fish products it is defined by the fao as including recreational subsistence and commercial fishing and the harvesting processing and marketing sectors the commercial activity is aimed at the delivery of fish and other seafood products for human consumption or for use as raw material in other industrial processes there are three principal industry sectors note the commercial sector comprises enterprises and individuals associated with wildcatch or aquaculture resources and the various transformations of those resources into products for sale it is also referred to as the seafood industry although nonfood items such as pearls are included among its products the traditional sector comprises enterprises and individuals associated with fisheries resources from which aboriginal people derive products in accordance with their traditions the recreational sector comprises enterprises and individuals associated for the purpose of recreation sport or sustenance with fisheries

commercial fishing is the capture of fish for commercial purposes those who practice it must often pursue fish far into the ocean under adverse conditions commercial fishermen harvest almost all aquatic species from tuna cod and salmon to shrimp krill lobster clams squid and crab in various fisheries for these species commercial fishing methods have become very efficient using large nets and sea going processing factories individual fishing quotas and international treaties seek to control the species and quantities caught a commercial fishing enterprise may vary from one man with a small boat with handcasting nets or a few pot traps to a huge fleet of trawlers processing tons of fish every day commercial fishing gear includes weights nets eg purse seine seine nets eg beach seine

pollution environmental effects of fishing climate change and fish farming conservation issues are part of marine conservation and are addressed in fisheries science programs there is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be caught and humanitys desire to catch them a problem that gets worse as the world population grows similar to other environmental issues there can be conflict between the fishermen who depend on fishing for their livelihoods and fishery scientists who realise that if future fish populations are to be sustainable then some fisheries must limit fishing or

egyptian wooden model of beer making in ancient egypt rosicrucian egyptian museum san jose california william hogarth beer street brooklyn museum beer is one of the worlds oldest prepared beverages possibly dating back to the early neolithic or bc when cereal was first farmed and is recorded in the written history of ancient iraq and ancient egypt archaeologists speculate that beer was instrumental in the formation of civilizations the earliest known chemical evidence of barley beer dates to circa bc from the site of godin tepe in the zagros mountains of western iran some of the earliest sumerian writings contain references to beer examples include a prayer to the goddess ninkasi known as the hymn to ninkasi which served as both a prayer as well as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people and the ancient advice fill your belly day and night make merry to gilgamesh recorded in the epic of gilgamesh by the alewife siduri may at least in part have referred to the consumption of beer the ebla tablets discovered in in ebla syria show that beer was produced in the city in bc a fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in china around bc unlike sake mold was not used to saccharify the rice amylolytic fermentation the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting almost any substance containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation it is likely that many cultures on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch independently invented beer bread and beer increased prosperity to a level that allowed time for development of other technologies and contributed to the building of civilizations at the cafe by edouard manet beer was spread through europe by germanic and celtic tribes as far back as bc and it was mainly brewed on a domestic scale the product that the early europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today alongside the basic starch source the early european beers might contain fruits honey numerous types of plants spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs what they did not contain was hops as that was a later addition first mentioned in europe around by a carolingian abbot and again in by abbess hildegard of bingen in william iv duke of bavaria adopted the reinheitsgebot purity law perhaps the oldest foodquality regulation still in use in the st century according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water hops and barley malt beer produced before the industrial revolution continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale although by the th century ad beer was also being produced and sold by european monasteries during the industrial revolution the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant by the end of the th century the development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results today the brewing industry is a global business consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries as of more than billion liters billion gallons the equivalent of a cube metres on a side of beer are sold per year producing total global revenues of billion billion in chinas beer consumption hit million hectoliters billion liters or nearly twice that of the united states but only percent sold were premium draught beers compared with percent in france and germany brewing main article brewing a thcentury brewery the process of making beer is known as brewing a dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history a company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a brewing company beer made on a domestic scale for noncommercial reasons is classified as homebrewing regardless of where it is made though most homebrewed beer is made in the home brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in developed countries which from the late th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only however the uk government relaxed legislation in followed by australia in and the usa in allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby the purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called wort and to convert the wort into the alcoholic beverage known as beer in a fermentation process effected by yeast diagram illustrating the process of brewing beer hot water tank mash tun malt hops copper hopback add yeast to fermenter heat exchanger bottling cask or keg the first step where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source normally malted barley with hot water is known as mashing hot water known as liquor in brewing terms is mixed with crushed malt or malts known as grist in a mash tun the mashing process takes around to hours during which the starches are converted to sugars and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains the grains are now washed in a process known as sparging this washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible the process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation the traditional process for wort separation is lautering in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist most modern breweries use a continuous sparge collecting the original wort and the sparge water together however it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer this process is known as second and third runnings brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing the sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle or copper so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper and boiled usually for about one hour during boiling water in the wort evaporates but the sugars and other components of the wort remain this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness flavour and aroma hops may be added at more than one point during the boil the longer the hops are boiled the more bitterness they contribute but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer after boiling the hopped wort is now cooled ready for the yeast in some breweries the hopped wort may pass through a hopback which is a small vat filled with hops to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter where the yeast is added during fermentation the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer in addition to producing ethanol fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation once fermentation is complete the yeast also settles leaving the beer clear fermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages primary and secondary once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity when the beer has fermented it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs aluminium cans or bottles for other sorts of beer ingredients malted barley before roasting the basic ingredients of beer are water a starch source such as malted barley able to be saccharified converted to sugars then fermented converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide a brewers yeast to produce the fermentation and a flavouring such as hops a mixture of starch sources may be used with a secondary starch source such as maize corn rice or sugar often being termed an adjunct especially when used as a lowercost substitute for malted barley less widely used starch sources include millet sorghum and cassava root in africa and potato in brazil and agave in mexico among others the amount of each starch source in a beer recipe is collectively called the grain bill water speights brewery public water well tap beer is composed mostly of water regions have water with different mineral components as a result different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer thus giving them a regional character for example dublin has hard water wellsuited to making stout such as guinness while the plzen region has soft water wellsuited to making pilsner pale lager such as pilsner urquell the waters of burton in england contain gypsum which benefits making pale ale to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as burtonisation starch source main articles malt and mash ingredients the starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer the most common starch source used in beer is malted grain grain is malted by soaking it in water allowing it to begin germination and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain darker malts will produce darker beers nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch this is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing after malting barley is milled which finally removes the hull breaking it into large pieces these pieces remain with the grain during the mash and act as a filter bed during lautering when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material other malted and unmalted grains including wheat rice oats and rye and less frequently corn and sorghum may be used some brewers have produced glutenfree beer made with sorghum with no barley malt for those who cannot consume gluten containing grains like wheat barley and rye hops main article hops hop cone in a hallertau germany hop yard flavouring beer is the sole major commercial use of hops the flower of the hop vine is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today the flowers themselves are often called hops the first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from ad in monastery rules written by adalhard the elder also known as adalard of corbie though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century before the thirteenth century and until the sixteenth century during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring beer was flavoured with other plants for instance glechoma hederacea combinations of various aromatic herbs berries and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used some beers today such as fraoch by the scottish heather ales company and cervoise lancelot by the french brasserielancelot company use plants other than hops for flavouring hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt the bitterness of beers is measured on the international bitterness units scale hops contribute floral citrus and herbal aromas and flavours to beer hops have an antibiotic effect that favours the activity of brewers yeast over less desirable microorganisms and aids in head retention the length of time that a foamy head created by carbonation will last the acidity of hops is a preservative yeast main articles brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and saccharomyces uvarum yeast is the microorganism that is responsible for fermentation in beer yeast metabolises the sugars extracted from grains which produces alcohol and carbon dioxide and thereby turns wort into beer in addition to fermenting the beer yeast influences the character and flavour the dominant types of yeast used to make beer are the topfermenting saccharomyces cerevisiae and bottomfermenting saccharomyces uvarum brettanomyces ferments lambics and torulaspora delbrueckii ferments bavarian weissbier before the role of yeast in fermentation was understood fermentation involved wild or airborne yeasts a few styles such as lambics rely on this method today but most modern fermentation adds pure yeast cultures clarifying agent main article finings see also vegetarianism and beer some brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer which typically precipitate collect as a solid out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product this process makes the beer appear bright and clean rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as wheat beers examples of clarifying agents include isinglass obtained from swimbladders of fish irish moss a seaweed kappa

microbrewery varies by region and by authority though is usually around barrels megalitres thousand imperial gallons or thousand us gallons a year a brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a pub or other eating establishment the highest density of breweries in the world most of them microbreweries exists in the german region of franconia especially in the district of upper franconia which has about breweries brewing at home is subject to regulation and prohibition in many countries restrictions on homebrewing were lifted in the uk in australia followed suit in and the usa in though individual states were allowed to pass their own laws limiting production international breweries since the globalisation of the beer market near the end of the th century becoming the largest brewery has been a game of merging with and overtaking other large breweries in the foundation of south african breweries bought the north american miller brewing company to found sabmiller becoming

article beer style kriek a variety of beer brewed with cherries while there are many types of beer brewed the basics of brewing beer are shared across national and cultural boundaries the traditional european brewing regions germany belgium england and the czech republic have local varieties of beer english writer michael jackson in his book the world guide to beer categorised beers from around the world in local style groups suggested by local customs and names fred eckhardt furthered jacksons work in the essentials of beer style in topfermented beers are most commonly produced with saccharomyces cerevisiae a topfermenting yeast which clumps and rises to the surface typically between and c and f at these temperatures yeast produces significant amounts of esters and other secondary flavour and aroma products and the result is often a beer with slightly fruity compounds resembling apple pear pineapple banana plum or prune among others after the introduction of hops into england from flanders in the th century ale referred to an unhopped fermented beverage beer being used to describe a brew with an infusion of hops the word ale comes from old english ealu plural ealo in turn from protogermanic alu plural alu ultimately from the protoindoeuropean base helut which holds connotations of sorcery magic possession intoxication the word beer comes from old english beor from protogermanic beuza probably from protoindoeuropean bheusom originally brewers yeast beer dregs although other theories have been provided connecting the word with old english beow barley or latin bibere to drink on the currency of two words for the same thing in the germanic languages the thcentury old icelandic poem alvissmal says ale it is called among men but among the gods beer cask ale hand pumps with pump clips detailing the beers and their breweries real ale is the term coined by the campaign for real ale camra in for beer brewed from traditional ingredients matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide it is applied to bottle conditioned and cask conditioned beers pale ale pale ale is a beer which uses a topfermenting yeast and predominantly pale malt it is one of the worlds major beer styles stout stout and porter are dark beers made using roasted malts or roast barley and typically brewed with slow fermenting yeast there are a number of variations including baltic porter dry stout and imperial stout the name porter was first used in to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river porters of london this same beer later also became known as stout though the word stout had been used as early as the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined mild mild ale has a predominantly malty palate it is usually dark coloured with an abv of to although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching abv and higher wheat wheat beer is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of malted barley wheat beers are usually topfermented in germany they have to be by law the flavour of wheat beers varies considerably depending upon the specific style lager a marzen style lager lager is the english name for cool fermenting beers of central european origin pale lagers are the most commonly consumed beers in the world the name lager comes from the german lagern for to store as brewers around bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months these brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment and to also clear of sediment when stored in cool conditions lager yeast is a cool bottomfermenting yeast saccharomyces pastorianus and typically undergoes primary fermentation at c f the fermentation phase and then is given a long secondary fermentation at c f the lagering phase during the secondary stage the lager clears and mellows the cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of esters and other byproducts resulting in a cleanertasting beer modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by gabriel sedlmayr the younger who perfected dark brown lagers at the spaten brewery in bavaria and anton dreher who began brewing a lager now known as vienna lager probably of amberred colour in vienna in with improved modern yeast strains most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage typically weeks lambic lambic a beer of belgium is naturally fermented using wild yeasts rather than cultivated many of these are not strains of brewers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness yeast varieties such as brettanomyces bruxellensis and brettanomyces lambicus are common in lambics in addition other organisms such as lactobacillus bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness bastar beer prepared from caryota urens measurement main article beer measurement beer is measured and assessed by bitterness by strength and by colour the perceived bitterness is measured by the international bitterness units scale ibu defined in cooperation between the american society of brewing chemists and the european brewery convention the international scale was a development of the european bitterness units scale often abbreviated as ebu and the bitterness values should be identical colour paulaner dunkel a dark lager beer colour is determined by the malt the most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts pale lager and pale ale are terms used for beers made from malt dried with coke coke was first used for roasting malt in but it was not until around that the term pale ale was used in terms of sales volume most of todays beer is based on the pale lager brewed in in the town of pilsen in the presentday czech republic the modern pale lager is light in colour with a noticeable carbonation fizzy bubbles and a typical alcohol by volume content of around the pilsner urquell bitburger and heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager as are the american brands budweiser coors and miller dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade other colourantssuch as caramelare also widely used to darken beers very dark beers such as stout use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer some have roasted unmalted barley strength see also beer measurement by strength beer ranges from less than alcohol by volume abv to around abv though this strength can be increased to around by repitching with champagne yeast and to abv by the freezedistilling process the alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style the pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of with a typical abv of the customary strength of british ales is quite low with many session beers being around abv some beers such as table beer are of such low alcohol content that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools the alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation the quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer primarily light beers to convert more complex carbohydrates starches to fermentable sugars alcohol is a byproduct of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above by volume low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content strongest beer the strength of beers has climbed during the later years of the th century vetter a abv degrees plato hence vetter doppelbock was listed in the guinness book of world records as the strongest beer at that time though samichlaus by the swiss brewer hurlimann had also been listed by the guinness book of world records as the strongest at abv since then some brewers have used champagne yeasts to increase the alcohol content of their beers samuel adams reached abv with millennium and then surpassed that amount to abv with utopias the strongest beer brewed in britain was bazs super brew by parish brewery a abv beer in september the scottish brewery brewdog produced ghost deer which at they claim to be the worlds strongest beer produced by fermentation alone the product claimed to be the strongest beer made is schorschbraus schorschbock with it was preceded by the end of history a belgian ale made by brewdog in the same company had previously made sink the bismarck a abv ipa and tactical nuclear penguin a abv imperial stout each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed until the desired strength is reached a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer the german brewery schorschbraus schorschbock a abv eisbock and hair of the dog s dave a abv barley wine made in used the same fractional

fonts at the delirium cafe in brussels draught beer from a pressurised keg is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world a metal keg is pressurised with carbon dioxide co gas which drives the beer to the dispensing tap or faucet some beers may be served with a nitrogencarbon dioxide mixture nitrogen produces fine bubbles resulting in a dense head and a creamy mouthfeel some types of beer can also be found in smaller disposable kegs called beer balls in the s guinness introduced the beer widget a nitrogenpressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense tight head

arrives in a pub it is placed horizontally on a frame called a stillage which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature typically between c or f before being tapped and venteda tap is driven through a usually rubber bung at the bottom of one end and a hard spile or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask which is now

transfusions dating back to activity leading to august decision edit in july armstrong filed a lawsuit in the texas court requesting that the court bar usada from pursuing its case or issuing any sanctions against him based on the claim that usada rules violate athletes constitutional rights to a fair trial and that the agency does not have jurisdiction in his case on july after the initial lawsuit was dismissed for being overly lengthy armstrong filed a revised lawsuit the same day usada announced lifetime bans against three of his former us postal service cycling team associates luis garcia del moral a team doctor michele ferrari a consulting doctor and jose pepe marti team trainer us district judge sam sparks issued his ruling on august he ruled in favor of usada however he questioned the timing and motivation of usadas investigation of armstrong and their apparent single minded determination to force armstrong to arbitrate but also noting in direct conflict with ucis equally evident desire not to proceed against him applying rational basis review to the federal arbitration act the stevens amateur sports act and various governing documents of usada usoc and us cycling sparks upheld usadas authority to investigate armstrong and initiate arbitration against him and that armstrongs right to due process could not be violated by usada before any proceedings had actually occurred four days after judge sparkss decision on august usada officially charged him with doping had it prevailed in arbitration armstrong would have been stripped of all of his results

later armstrong while publicly maintaining his innocence decided to not officially challenge the usada allegations in a statement armstrong said that the usada had engaged in an unconstitutional witch hunt based on outlandish and heinous claims he added that he would have been more than willing to fight the charges what he described as usadas onesided and unfair arbitration process was not worth the toll on his foundation and his family there comes a point in every mans life when he has to say enough is enough armstrong said for me that time is now the new york times reported that according to the wada code by failing to contest such serious charges of doping offenses armstrong forfeited all awards and prizes earned after august including his tour titles he was also banned from any sport that uses the world antidoping codeeffectively ending his competitive career at the same time armstrong told usada through his attorneys that he could not take part in any usada arbitration because the uci was the only body competent to hear the case new york times sports reporter juliet macur wrote in her book about the armstrong scandal cycle of lies that armstrong opted not to contest the charges in hopes of keeping usadas evidence confidential he also suggested that the uci not contest the ban on the basis that while usadas findings were unsound its arbitration process was so tilted against a suspected doper that it would not be worth the effort according to macur armstrong hoped to be able to portray himself as usadas victim uci and ioc responses and reasoned decision edit cyclings ruling body the union cycliste internationale uci requested on august a reasoned decision from usada explaining why usada thinks the uci should strip armstrong of his titles on october usada

mastermind of what it described as the most sophisticated professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen the report detailed numerous blood test results that proved armstrong was guilty of blood doping as well as over million in payments to ferrari it contended that the normal eightyear statute of limitations for doping offenses did not apply because of armstrongs fraudulent concealment of his doping armstrong usada said could not be allowed to benefit from the statute of limitations when he lied under oath in both the sca case and the french investigation intimidated witnesses and submitted affidavits that he knew were false longstanding precedent in american courts holds that the statute of limitations does not apply when a defendant engages in fraudulent acts among those who testified were betsy amp frankie andreu who repeated their testimony of the sca promotions case along with floyd landis and tyler hamilton who repeated allegations made over the preceding years statements were also taken from former teammates including george hincapie levi leipheimer and michael barry all of whom confessed to doping during their careers as well as witnessing armstrong using performance enhancing drugs before its release armstrongs legal representative tim herman described the usada reasoned decision as a onesided hatchet job a taxpayerfunded tabloid piece rehashing old disproved unreliable allegations based largely on axegrinders serial perjurers coerced testimony sweetheart deals and threatinduced stories on october uci announced that it would not appeal usadas decision to the court of arbitration for sport meaning that it accepted usadas sanctions of a lifetime ban for armstrong and stripping of all results since august including all

the summer olympics from its record books and had requested the return of his bronze medal from the time trial other reactions edit the french cycling federation ffc issued a statement on august in

announced they do not want vacated positions to be reassigned and want reimbursement of lance armstrongs prizes obtained during the tour de france and other competitions for an amount assessed at million euros for the development of cycling among the youth and the prevention of doping the president of the world anti doping agency wada john fahey stated that he believed armstrongs decision not to contest the usadas claims pursuant to its process indicated there was substance to those charges robert boland professor of sports management at new york university believed that armstrongs marketing potential was still strong after the usadas decision stating armstrongs story has not been diminished heres a guy who essentially was at deaths door with cancer and came back that example

made an apology to the livestrong staff before his interview with winfrey armstrong said that while doping he neither felt that it was wrong nor felt bad about what he was doing in that interview armstrong also insisted he was clean during the two comeback years of and after uci had implemented its biological passport program that included stricter whereabouts rules and the monitoring of blood profiles macur wrote that armstrong decided to admit his doping because he knew he would be questioned under oath about it in the false claims act suit filed by landis he was also concerned about the

through the design made by the architect george strickland kingston in light had fondly written of the sicilian city of catania the two principal streets cross each other at right angles in the square

opposition a site on rising ground close to the river torrens which was the chief water supply for the fledgling colony lights vision as it has been termed has meant that the initial design of adelaide required little modification as the settlement grew and prospered citation needed adelaide was established as a planned colony of free immigrants promising civil liberties and freedom from religious persecution based upon the ideas of edward gibbon wakefield wakefield had read accounts of australian settlement while in prison in london for attempting to abduct an heiress and realised that the eastern colonies suffered from a lack of available labour due to the practice of giving land grants to all arrivals wakefields idea was for the government to survey and sell the land at a rate that would maintain land values high enough to be unaffordable for labourers and journeymen funds raised from the sale of land were to be used to bring out working class emigrants who would have to work hard for the monied settlers to ever afford their own land as a result of this policy adelaide does not share the convict settlement history of other australian cities like sydney melbourne brisbane and hobart north terrace in as it was believed that in a colony of free settlers there would be little crime no provision was made for a gaol in colonel lights plan however by mid the south

wharf at port adelaide in addition houses for public officials and missionaries and outstations for police and surveyors were also constructed during gawlers governorship adelaide had also become economically selfsufficient during this period but at heavy cost as a result of gawlers public works the colony was heavily in debt and relied on bailouts from london to stay afloat gawler was recalled and replaced by governor grey in grey slashed public expenditure against heavy opposition although its impact was negligible at this point silver was discovered in glen osmond that year

sandhills swamps and marshlands were prevalent around the coast the loss of the sandhills to urban development had a particularly destructive effect on the coastline due to erosion where practical the

with five squares in the adelaide city centre and a ring of parks known as the adelaide parklands surrounding it lights selection of the location for the city was initially unpopular with the early settlers as well as south australias first governor john hindmarsh due to its distance from the harbour at port adelaide and the lack of fresh water there light successfully persisted with his choice of location against this initial opposition the benefits of lights design are numerous adelaide has had wide multilane roads from its beginning an easily navigable cardinal direction grid layout and

adelaide oval stadium in the background suburban expansion has to some extent outgrown lights original plan numerous former outlying villages and country towns as well as the satellite city of elizabeth have been enveloped by its suburban sprawl expanding developments in the adelaide hills region led to the construction of the south eastern freeway to cope with growth which has subsequently led to new developments and further improvements to that transport corridor similarly the booming development in adelaides south led to the construction of the southern expressway new roads are not the only transport infrastructure developed to cope with the urban growth the obahn busway is an example of a unique solution to tea tree gullys transport woes in the s the development of the nearby suburb of golden grove in the late s is an example of wellthoughtout urban planning the newer suburban areas as a whole however are not as integrated into the urban layout as much as older areas and therefore place more stress on adelaides transportation system although not on a level comparable with melbourne or sydney king william street one of the widest main streets in an australian capital city viewed from victoria square in the s a metropolitan adelaide transport study plan was proposed in order to cater for the future growth of the city the plan involved the construction of freeways expressways and the upgrade of certain aspects of the public transport system the then premier steele hall approved many parts of the plan and the government went as far as purchasing land for the project the later labor government elected under don dunstan shelved the plan but allowed the purchased land to remain vacant should the future need for freeways arise in the liberal party won government and premier david tonkin committed his government to selling off the land acquired for the mats plan ensuring that even when needs changed the construction of most matsproposed freeways would be impractical some parts of this land have been used for transport eg the obahn busway and southern expressway while most has been progressively subdivided for residential use in the sa government announced plans for a network of transportoriented developments across the adelaide metropolitan area and purchased a hectare industrial site at bowden for million as the first of these developments the site covers square metres or about hectares and is bounded by park terrace to the south the adelaide to outer harbour railway line to the west drayton street to the north and sixth and seventh streets to the east housing edit main article australian residential architectural styles historically adelaides suburban residential areas have been characterised by singlestorey detached houses built on squaremetre acre blocks a relative lack of suitable locally available timber for construction purposes led to the early development of a brickmaking industry as well as the use of stone for houses and other buildings a row of terrace houses at the east end of north terrace there is a wide variety in the styles of these predominately brick and to a lesser degree stone andor stonefaced singlestorey detached houses after both of the world wars the use of red bricks was popular in the s cream bricks became popular and in the s deep red and brown bricks became popular until the s roofs tended to be clad with corrugated iron or clay tiles usually red clay since then cement tiles and colourbond corrugated and other types of iron have also become popular most roofs are pitched flat roofs are not common up to the s the majority of houses were of double brick construction upon dwarf wall foundations progressively since then there has been a move to brick veneer over a timber frame on a concrete slab foundation and more recently over a steel frame in addition to this a significant factor in adelaides suburban history is the role of the south australian housing trust in the s and s many of the older houses were demolished and replaced by home units a group of threetofive singlestorey dwellings on a common title with shared access twostorey blocks of flats were also common in this period dutch colonial architecture is rare in adelaide but there are a few noteworthy examples in the style popularised in the united states in the s the style was brought to south australia by george gavin lawson in the st century a significant factor is the government policy of urban infill where singlestorey detached houses are being demolished the land subdivided and

the innercity region the urban heat island phenomenon can cause temperatures to be c f higher in the city than in surrounding areas the urban heat island effect is increased as the demand for highrise buildings in the cbd grows because urban heat islands are often caused by the absorption of heat from tall buildings in concentrated areas additionally the growth in adelaides metropolitan area has

exploration edit grey was born in lisbon portugal the only son of bvt lieutenantcolonel george grey of the th cambridgeshire regiment of foot who was killed at the battle of badajoz in spain just a few days before his mother elizabeth anne on the balcony of her hotel in lisbon overheard two officers speak of her husbands death and this brought on his premature birth she was the daughter of a retired soldier turned irish clergyman major later rev john vignoles grey was sent to the royal grammar school guildford in surrey and was admitted to the royal military college in early in he was gazetted ensign in the rd county of dublin regiment of foot in his regiment having been sent to ireland he developed much sympathy with the irish peasantry whose misery made a great impression on him he was promoted lieutenant in and obtained a firstclass certificate at the examinations of the royal military college sandhurst in citation needed in at the age of grey led a catastrophically illprepared expedition of exploration of northwest australia only one man of his party had seen northern australia before it was at that time believed that a great river entered the indian ocean from the northwest of australia and that the country it drained might be suitable for colonisation grey in conjunction with lieutenant franklin lushington of the th east norfolk regiment of foot offered to explore this country and on july he sailed from plymouth in command of a party of five the others being lushington dr william walker a surgeon and naturalist and corporals coles and auger of the royal sappers and miners others joined the party at cape town and early in december they landed at hanover bay wrecked almost drowned and completely lost with grey speared in the hip in a skirmish with aborigines they traced the course of the glenelg river before giving up they were picked up by the beagle and lynher and taken to mauritius to recover two years later grey returned to western australia and was again wrecked with his party again including surgeon walker at kalbarri they were the first europeans to see the gascoyne river but then had to walk to perth surviving the journey through the efforts of kaiber a whadjuk noongar who organised food and what water could be found they survived by drinking liquid mud at about this time grey became one of the few europeans to learn the noongar language of southwest western australia upon the death of sir richard spencer rn kch the government resident magistrate at king george sound western australia in july grey was promoted to captain and appointed temporary resident magistrate marriage and children edit on november at king george sound grey married eliza lucy spencer the daughter of the late government resident their only child born in in south australia died aged months it was not a happy marriage grey obstinate in his domestic affairs as in his first expeditions accused his wife unjustly of flirting with rear admiral sir henry keppel on the voyage to cape town in and sent her away from him to live a life of misery until old age brought sense to him and they were reunited formally but unhappily in grey adopted annie maria matthews in following the death of her father greys halfbrother sir godfrey thomas she married seymour thorne george on december on kawau island governor of south australia edit grey was the third governor of south australia from to as the british government was concerned about the treatment of aborigines by settlers and grey was known to have sympathies with the indigenous people he oversaw the colony during a difficult formative period despite being seen as less handson than his predecessor george gawler his fiscally responsible measures ensured the colony was in good shape by the time he left to govern new zealand governor of new zealand edit grey served as governor of new zealand twice from to and from to he was arguably the most influential figure during the european settlement of new zealand during much of the th century during this time european settlement accelerated and in the number of pakeha came to equal the number of maori at around each settlers were keen to obtain land and some maori were willing to sell but there were also strong pressures to retain land in particular from the maori king movement grey had to manage the demand for land for the settlers to farm and the commitments in the treaty of waitangi that the maori chiefs retained full exclusive and undisturbed possession of their lands and estates forests fisheries and other properties the treaty also specifies that maori will sell land only to the crown the potential for conflict between the maori and settlers was exacerbated as the british authorities progressively eased restrictions on land sales after an agreement at the end of between the company and colonial secretary lord john russell which provided for land purchases by the new zealand company from the crown at a discount price and a charter to buy and sell land under government supervision money raised by the government from sales to the company would be spent on assisting migration to new zealand the agreement was hailed by the company as all that we could desire our company is really to be the agent of the state for colonizing nz the government waived its right of preemption in the wellington region wanganui and new plymouth in september first term edit grey was appointed the third governor of new zealand in during the tenure of his predecessor robert fitzroy violence over land ownership broke out in the wairau valley in the south island in june then in march hone heke began the flagstaff war the causes of which can be attributed to the conflict between what the ngapuhi understood to be the meaning of the treaty of waitangi and the actions of succeeding governors of asserting authority over the maori fighting in the nelson area by ngati toa edit a land dispute that began before greys arrival in zealand was a dispute as to sale of land on the wairau plains to captain john william dundas blenkinsop he had negotiated with ngati toa that he could take wood and water from cloudy bay in payment of a ships cannon but the document that blenkinsopp drew up in english which the chiefs could not read stated that acres of the wairau plains were sold to blenkinsopp a major clash came in when te rauparaha and his nephew te rangihaeata tried to prevent the survey of lands in the wairau plains these lands had been claimed by the new zealand company on two grounds alleged purchase by captain blenkinsop master of a sydney whaler in and the negotiations between their principal agent colonel wakefield and rauparaha the head of this tribe in the ngati toa war party warned off the surveyors but they persisted te rauparaha burnt down a whare hut which contained the surveyors equipment the local magistrate ordered his arrest and deputised about settlers for this purpose te rauparaha resisted fighting broke out and settlers and at least four maori were killed te rangihaeata the warlike nephew of te rauparaha insisted on killing the captured men as his wife who was te rauparahas daughter and capt benkinsops exwife had been accidentally shot and killed the settlers were furious as many of those killed in utu were unarmed quakers te rauparaha was astonished not to face a strong british military reaction he left the rangitane land he had conquered and never returned these events took place during the governorship of robert fitzroy it was not until that governor grey had te rauparaha arrested however his imprisonment which remained controversial amongst the ngati toa was not related to the wairau affray hone heke and the fighting in the bay of islands edit in george grey arrived in new zealand to take up his appointment as governor at this time hone heke challenged the authority of the british beginning by cutting down the flagstaff on flagstaff hill at kororareka on this flagstaff the flag of the united tribes of new zealand had previously flown now the union jack was hoisted hence the flagstaff symbolised the grievances of heke and his ally te ruki kawiti as to changes that had followed the signing of the treaty of waitangi there were many causes of the flagstaff war and heke had a number of grievances in relation to the treaty of waitangi while land acquisition by the church missionary society cms had been controversial the rebellion lead by heke was directed against the colonial forces with the cms missionaries trying to persuade heke to end the fighting despite the fact that tamati waka nene and most of ngapuhi sided with the government the small and ineptly led british had been beaten at battle of ohaeawai grey armed with the financial support and far more troops armed with pounder cannons that had been denied to fitzroy attacked and occupied kawiti s fortress at ruapekapeka forcing kawiti to retreat the ngapuhi were astonished that the british could keep an army of nearly soldiers in the field continuously hekes confidence waned after he was wounded in battle with tamati waka nene and his warriors and by the realisation that the british had far more resources than he could muster including some pakeha maori who supported the colonial forces after the battle of ruapekapeka heke and kawiti were ready for peace it was tamati waka nene they approached to act as the intermediary to negotiate with governor grey who accepted the advice of nene that heke and kawiti should not be punished for their rebellion the fighting in the north ended and there was no punitive confiscation of ngapuhi land the ngati rangatahi and hutt valley campaign edit colonists arrived in port nicholson wellington in november in ships charted by the new zealand company within months the new zealand company purported to purchase approximately million acres million hectares in nelson wellington whanganui and taranaki disputes arose as to the validity of purchases of land which disputes remained unresolved when grey became the governor the company saw itself as a prospective quasigovernment of new zealand and in and proposed splitting the colony in two along a line from mokau in the west to cape kidnappers in the east with the north reserved for maori and missionaries while the south would become a selfgoverning province known as new victoria and managed by the company for that purpose britains colonial secretary rejected the proposal the company was known for its vigorous attacks on those it perceived as its opponents the british colonial office successive governors of new zealand and the church missionary society cms that was led by the rev henry williams williams attempted to interfere with the land purchasing practices of the company which exacerbated the illwill that was directed at the cms by the company in wellington and the promoters of colonisation in auckland who had access to the governor and to the newspapers that had started publication the unresolved land disputes resulted from the operations of the new zealand company erupted into fighting in the hutt valley in the ngati rangatahi were determined to retain possession of their land they assembled a force of about warriors led by te rangihaeata the cousin of te rauparaha and the person who had killed the unarmed captives in the wairau affray the governor grey moved troops into the area and by february had assembled nearly a thousand men together with some maori allies from the te ati awa hapu to begin the hutt valley campaign the maori attacked taita on march but were repulsed by a company of the th regiment the same day grey declared martial law in the wellington area richard taylor a cms missionary from whanganui attempted to persuade the ngati tama and ngati rangatahi to leave the disputed land eventually grey paid compensation for the potato crop they had planted on the land he also gave them acres at kaiwharawhara by the modern ferry terminal chief taringakuri agreed to these terms but when the settlers tried to move onto the land they were frightened off on february the british and their te ati awa allies burnt the maori pa at maraenuku in the hutt valley which had been built on land that the settlers claimed to own the ngati rangatahi retaliated on and march by raiding settlers farms destroying furniture smashing windows killing pigs and threatening the settlers with death if they gave the alarm they murdered andrew gillespie and his son families of settlers moved into wellington for safety governor grey proclaimed martial law on march sporadic fighting continued including a major attack on a defended position at boulcotts farm on may on august one of the last engagements was fought the battle of battle hill after which te rangihaeata left the area the hutt valley campaign was followed by the wanganui campaign from april to july in january fifteen chiefs of the area including te rauparaha had sent a combined letter to the newly arrived governor grey pledging their loyalty to the crown after intercepting letters from te rauparaha grey realised he was playing a double game he was receiving and sending secret instructions to the local maori who were attacking settlers in a surprise attack on his pa at taupo plimmerton at dawn on july te rauparaha who was now quite elderly was captured and taken prisoner the justification given for the arrest of te rauparaha was that he supplying weapons to maori deemed to be in open rebellion against the crown however charges were never laid against te rauparaha so that his detention was unlawful while greys declaration of martial law was within his authority internment without trial would only be lawful if it had been authorised by statute te rauparaha was held prisoner on hms driver then he was taken to auckland on hms calliope and he remained imprisoned until january his son tamihana was studying christianity in auckland and te rauparaha gave him a solemn message that their iwi should not take utu against the government tamihana returned to his rohe to stop a planned uprising tamihana sold the wairau land to the government for pounds grey spoke to te rauaparaha and persuaded him to give up all outstanding claims to land in the wairau valley then realising he was old and sick he allowed te rauparaha to return to his people at otaki in government at auckland edit auckland was made the new capital in march and by the time grey was appointed governor in it had become a commercial centre as well as including the administrative institutions such as the supreme court after the conclusion of the war in the north government policy was to place a buffer zone of european settlement between the ngapuhi and auckland the background to the invasion of waikato in also in part reflected a belief that the auckland was at risk from attack by the waikato maori governor grey had to contend with newspapers that were unequivocal to their support of the interests of the settlers the auckland times auckland chronicle the southern cross which started by william brown as a weekly paper in and the new zealander which was started in by john williamson these newspapers were known for their partisan editorial policies both william brown and john williamson were aspiring politicians the southern cross supported the land claimants such as the new zealand company and vigorously attacked governor greys administration while the the new zealander supported the ordinary settler and the maori the northern war adversely affected business in auckland such that the southern cross stopped publishing from april to july hugh carleton who also became a politician was the editor of the new zealander then later established the anglomaori warder which followed an editorial policy in opposition to governor grey at the time of the northern war the southern cross and the new zealander blamed henry williams and the other cms missionaries for the flagstaff war the new zealander newspaper in a thinly disguise reference to henry williams with the reference to their rangatira pakeha gentlemen correspondents went on to state we consider these english traitors far more guilty and deserving of severe punishment than the brave natives whom they have advised and misled cowards and knaves in the full sense of the terms they have pursued their traitorous schemes afraid to risk their own persons yet artfully sacrificing others for their own aggrandizement while probably at the same time they were most hypocritically professing most zealous loyalty official communications also blamed the cms missionaries for the flagstaff war in a letter of june to william ewart gladstone the colonial secretary in sir robert peel s government governor grey referred to the land acquired by the cms missionaries and commented that her majestys government may also rest satisfied that these individuals cannot be put in possession of these tracts of land without a large expenditure of british blood and money by the end of his first term as governor grey had changed his opinion as to the role of the cms missionaries which was limited to attempts to persuade hone heke bring an end to the fighting with the british soldiers and the ngapuhi lead by tamati waka nene who remained loyal to the crown when he his returned to new zealand in for his second term as governor sir george and henry williams meet at the waimate mission station in november also in henrys son edward marsh williams was appointed by sir george to be the resident magistrate for the bay of islands and northern districts legacy of greys first term as governor edit during greys first tenure as governor of new zealand he was created a knight commander of the order of the bath when grey was knighted he chose tamati waka nene as one of his esquires grey was greatly to influence the final form of the new zealand constitution act after the act was largely suspended at his request grey was briefly governorinchief grey oversaw the establishment of the first provinces of new zealand he earned particular respect for his handling of maori affairs from to he took pains to show maori that he observed the terms of the treaty of waitangi assuring them that their land rights would be fully recognised in the taranaki district maori were very reluctant to sell their land but elsewhere grey was much more successful and nearly million acres km were purchased from maori with the result that british settlements expanded quickly grey was less successful in his efforts to assimilate the maori he lacked the financial means to realise his plans although he subsidised mission schools requiring them to teach in english only a few hundred maori children attended them at any one time grey gave land for the establishment of auckland grammar school in newmarket auckland in the school was officially recognised as an educational establishment in through the auckland grammar school appropriation act of the provincial government greys collection of maori artefacts one of the earliest from new zealand and assembled during his first governorship was donated to the british museum in second term as governor of new zealand edit sir george grey grey was again appointed governor in to replace governor thomas gore browne serving until his second term as governor was greatly different from the first as he had to deal with the demands of an elected parliament which had been established in invasion of the kingitanga edit immediately prior to greys reappointment as governor there were rising tensions in taranaki that eventually led to the involvement of british military forces at waitara in what is sometime called the first taranaki war from march until the fighting subsided in the leaders of the king movement or kingitanga had written a letter to governor browne stating that the waikato tribes had never signed the treaty of waitangi and that they were a separate nation browne regarded the stance of the kingitanga as an act of disloyalty and prepared plans for the invasion of waikato in part to uphold the queens supremacy in the face of the kingitanga challenge grey launched the invasion of the waikato in to take control of the heartland of the kingitanga the war brought thousands of british troops to new zealand men served in the british forces at some point during the campaign with a peak of about troops in march in the later s the british government determined to withdraw imperial troops from new zealand at the time the maori chiefs te kooti and titokowaru had the colonial government and settlers extremely alarmed with a series of military successes with the support of the premier edward stafford grey evaded instructions from the colonial office to finalise the return of the regiments which had commenced in and in the end the british government recalled grey in february he was replaced by sir george bowen and during his term hostilities concluded with the abandoned pursuit of war leader riwha titokowaru again in taranaki in the legacy of sir george grey edit grey was greatly respected by maori and often travelled with a company of chiefs he induced leading chiefs to write down their accounts of maori traditions legends and customs his principal informant wiremu maihi te rangikaheke taught grey to speak maori historian michael king noted he learned maori and persuaded maori authorities to commit their legends and traditions to writing some of which were subsequently published his collected papers would turn out to be the largest single repository of maorilanguage manuscripts grey bought kawau island in on his return to new zealand for his second term as governor for years he lavished large amounts of his personal wealth on the islands development including enlarging and remodelling mansion house the former residence of the copper mine superintendent here he planted a huge array of exotic trees and shrubs acclimatised many bird and animal species and amassed a celebrated collection of rare books and manuscripts artworks and curiosities and artefacts from the maori people over whom he had ruled in during greys second term as governor the capital was transferred to wellington which was seen as a better choice for an administrative capital because of its proximity to the south island governor of cape colony edit portrait of sir george grey as governor of the cape colony grey was governor of cape colony from december to august he founded grey college bloemfontein in and grey high school in port elizabeth in in he laid the foundation stone of the new somerset hospital cape town when he left the cape in he presented the national library of south africa with his remarkable personal collection of medieval and renaissance manuscripts and rare books in south africa grey dealt firmly with the natives but endeavoured by setting apart tracts of land for their exclusive use to protect them from the white colonists he more than once acted as arbitrator between the government of the orange free state and the natives and eventually came to the conclusion that a federated south africa would be a good thing for everyone the orange free state would have been willing to join the federation and it is probable that the transvaal would also have agreed however grey was years before his time and the colonial office would not agree to his proposals in spite of their instructions grey continued to advocate union and in connection with other matters such as the attempt to settle soldiers in south africa after the crimean war he several times disregarded his instructions when all the circumstances are considered it is not surprising that he was recalled in he had however scarcely reached england before a change of government led to his being given another term on the understanding that his schemes for the federation of south africa should be abandoned and that he would in future obey his instructions grey was convinced that the boundaries of the south african colonies should be widened but could not obtain the support of the british government he was still working for this support when war with the maori having broken out it was decided that grey should again be appointed governor of new zealand when he left his popularity among the people of cape colony was unbounded and the statue erected at cape town during his lifetime describes him as a governor who by his high character as a christian a statesman and a gentleman had endeared himself to all classes of the community and who by his zealous devotion to the best interests of south africa and his able and just administration has secured the approbation and gratitude of all her majestys subjects in this part of her dominions premier of new zealand edit parliament of new zealand years term electorate party th

independent in he was elected superintendent of auckland province march october he stood in the general election for both the auckland west and the thames electorates in the general election in the twomember auckland electorate only grey and patrick dignan were put forward as candidates and were thus declared elected on december the twomember thames electorate was contested by six candidates including julius vogel who was premier in william rowe and charles featherstone mitchell on election day january grey attracted the highest number of votes and unexpectedly rowe beat vogel into second place vogel also stood in wanganui where he was returned hence grey and rowe were declared elected for thames a protest against greys election was lodged with the returning officer the following day stating that grey had not been eligible to stand in thames as he had already been elected in auckland west this petition was filed to the house of representatives at the end of january with this controversy going on for several months unresolved grey advised in mid june in a series of telegrams that he had chosen to represent auckland west on july the report of the committee inquiring into his election for thames was read to the house it was found that this was in accordance with the law but that he had to make a decision for which electorate he would sit on july grey announced that he would represent thames and he moved that a byelection be held in auckland west for the seat that he would vacate there photograph of sir george grey grey opposed the abolition of the provinces but his opposition proved ineffective and the provincial system was abolished in on the defeat of harry atkinson as premier on october he was elected premier by parliament his government did not operate particularly well with grey seeking to dominate the government and coming into conflict with the governor his term as premier is regarded by historians as a failure towards the end of greys government

threemember christchurch electorate samuel paull andrews and edward stevens came second with equal numbers of votes votes ahead of edward richardson richardson petitioned against greys return on

were great advantages in trading with these strangers whom they called tauiwi the bay of islands offered a safe anchorage and had a high maori population to attract ships maori began to supply food and timber what maori wanted was respect plus firearms alcohol and other goods of european manufacture kororareka developed as a result of this trade but soon earned a very bad reputation a community without laws and full of prostitution and became known as the hell hole of the pacific despite the translation of its name being how sweet is the penguin korora meaning blue penguin and reka meaning sweet european law had no influence and maori law was seldom enforced within the towns area fighting on the beach at kororareka in march between northern and southern hapu within the ngapuhi iwi became known as the girls war on january at the christ church governor hobson read his proclamations which were the beginnings of the treaty of waitangi in the presence of a number of settlers and the maori chief moka te kaingamataa a document confirming what had happened was signed at this time by around forty witnesses including moka the only maori signatory the following week the treaty proceedings would then move across to the western side of the bay to waitangi by this time kororareka was an important mercantile centre and served as a vital resupply port for whaling and sealing operations when the colony of new zealand was founded in that year hobson was reluctant to choose kororareka as his capital due to its bad reputation instead he purchased land at okiato situated five kilometres to the south and renamed it russell in honour of the secretary of state for the colonies lord john russell captain hobson soon decided that the move to the okiato site was a mistake and auckland was selected as the new capital not long after kororareka was part of the port of russell and after russell okiato became virtually deserted kororareka gradually became known as russell also in january governor robert fitzroy officially designated kororareka as part of the township of russell today the name russell applies only to kororareka while the former capital is known either by its original name of okiato or as old russell at the beginning of the flagstaff war in touched off by the repeated felling and reerection of the symbol of british sovereignty on flagstaff hill above the town the town of kororarekarussell was sacked by hone heke after diversionary raids drew away the british defenders the flagstaff was felled for the fourth time and the inhabitants fled aboard british ships which then shelled and destroyed most of the houses hone heke directed his warriors not to interfere with christ church and the pompallier mission citation needed in jean baptiste pompallier

contents language background implementation killing of children killing of adults gassing technology and personnel transfer victim numbers opposition church action postwar legacy doctors trial others involved memorials see also notes references external links language edit euthanasia from greek good death eu well or good thanatos death refers to the practice of intentionally ending a life in order to relieve pain and suffering hitlers directive to create the programme used the german term gnadentod which translates to merciful death the aktion t programme used the term euthanasia as bureaucratic cover and in the minimal public relations efforts see poster to invest what was essentially an outgrowth of eugenics with greater medical legitimacy it is however clear that little if any of the killing was done to alleviate pain or suffering on the part of the victims rather the bulk of the evidence including faked death certificates deception of the victims and of the victims families and widespread use of cremation indicates the killing was done solely according to the sociopolitical aims and beliefs of the perpetrators background edit this poster from around reads reichsmark is what this person suffering from a hereditary defect costs the peoples community during his lifetime fellow citizen that is your money too read a new people the monthly magazine of the bureau for race politics of the nsdap the t programme stemmed from the nazi partys policy of racial hygiene the belief that the german people needed to be cleansed of the socalled racial enemies which included people with disabilities as well as anyone confined to a mental health facility the euthanasia programme was a major step in the evolution of policy that culminated in the extermination of the jews of europe during the holocaust the ideas of racial hygiene and what was after labelled social darwinism were present in many western countries in the early th century emerging information about genetic diseases and conditions led people to think they could prevent their being passed on to future generations the eugenics movement had many followers among educated people being particularly strong in the united states the idea of sterilising those carrying hereditary defects or exhibiting what was thought to be hereditary antisocial behaviour was widely accepted the united states sweden switzerland and other countries also passed laws authorizing sterilization of certain classes of people for example between and sweden sterilised people on eugenic grounds the policy and research agenda in racial hygiene and eugenics were actively promoted by emil kraepelin the eugenic sterilization of persons diagnosed with and viewed as predisposed to schizophrenia was advocated by eugene bleuler who presumed racial deterioration because of mental and physical cripples in his textbook of psychiatry the more severely burdened should not propagate themselves if we do nothing but make mental and physical cripples capable of propagating themselves and the healthy stocks have to limit the number of their children because so much has to be done for the maintenance of others if natural selection is generally suppressed then unless we will get new measures our race must rapidly deteriorate hitlers ideology had embraced the enforcement of racial hygiene from his early days in his book mein kampf hitler wrote he who is bodily and mentally not sound and deserving may not perpetuate this misfortune in the bodies of his children the volkische peoples state has to perform the most gigantic rearingtask here one day however it will appear as a deed greater than the most victorious wars of our present bourgeois era the nazis began to implement racial hygiene policies as soon as they came to power the july law for the prevention of hereditarily diseased offspring prescribed compulsory sterilisation for people with a range of conditions thought to be hereditary such as schizophrenia epilepsy huntingtons chorea and imbecility sterilisation was also mandated for chronic alcoholism and other forms of social deviance this law was administered by the interior ministry under wilhelm frick through special hereditary health courts erbgesundheitsgerichte which examined the inmates of nursing homes asylums prisons agedcare homes and special schools to select those to be sterilised it is estimated that people were sterilised under this law between and within the nazi administration some suggested that the programme should be extended to people with physical disabilities but such ideas had to be expressed carefully given that one of the most powerful figures of the regime joseph goebbels had a deformed right leg after the acute shortage of labour in germany arising from the demands of the crash rearmament programme meant that anyone capable of work was deemed to be useful and thus exempted from the law the rate of sterilisation declined as a related aspect of the medical and scientific basis of this programme the nazi doctors took thousands of brains from euthanasia victims for research implementation edit dr karl brandt hitler s personal physician and organiser of action t philipp bouhler head of the t programme although officially started in september action t may have been initiated with a trial case in late hitler instructed his personal physician karl brandt to evaluate a familys petition for the mercy killing of their blind physically and developmentally disabled infant boy the boy was eventually killed in july hitler instructed brandt to proceed in the same manner in similar cases the reich committee for the scientific registering of hereditary and congenital illnesses was established on august three weeks after the killing of the aforementioned boy it was to prepare and proceed with the registration of sick children or newborns identified as defective secret killing of infants began in and increased after the war started by more than children had been killed hitler was in favour of killing those whom he judged to be unworthy of life in a conference with health minister leonardo conti and the head of the reich chancellery hans lammers a few months before the euthanasia decree hitler gave as examples of life unworthy of life severely mentally ill people who he believed could only be bedded on sawdust or sand because they perpetually dirtied themselves or who put their own excrement into their mouths eating it and so on both his physician dr karl brandt and the head of the reich chancellery hans lammers testified after the war that hitler had told them as early as at the time the sterilisation law was passed that he favoured killing the incurably ill but recognised that public opinion would not accept this in hitler told the reich doctors leader dr gerhard wagner that the question could not be taken up in peacetime such a problem could be more smoothly and easily carried out in war he said he intended he wrote in the event of a war radically to solve the problem of the mental asylums this issue according to the nazi regime assumed new urgency in wartime people with severe disabilities even if sterilised still needed institutional care they occupied places in facilities which during war would be needed for wounded soldiers and people evacuated from bombed cities they were housed and fed at the expense of the state and took up the time of doctors and nurses the nazis barely tolerated this support in peacetime few supported care for such people in wartime especially in the last years of world war ii when conditions overall were so terrible in germany as a leading nazi doctor dr hermann pfannmuller said the idea is unbearable to me that the best the flower of our youth must lose its life at the front in order that feebleminded and irresponsible asocial elements can have a secure existence in the asylum even before the nazis came to power the german eugenics movement had an extreme wing led by alfred hoche and karl binding as early as binding had advocated killing those with lives judged to be life unworthy of life lebensunwertes leben germany in the years after world war i was particularly susceptible to ideas of this kind darwinism was interpreted by people in the movement as justifying the nations promotion of the propagation of beneficial genes and prevent the propagation of harmful ones lifton notes the argument went that the best young men died in war causing a loss to the volk of the best available genes the genes of those who did not fight the worst genes then proliferated freely accelerating biological and cultural degeneration the government the eugenicists who argued must intervene to prevent this citation needed these views had gained ground after when the depression caused sharp cuts in funding to state mental hospitals creating squalor and overcrowding most german eugenicists were already strongly nationalist and antisemitic and embraced the nazi regime with enthusiasm many were appointed to positions in the health ministry and german research institutes their ideas were gradually adopted by the majority of the german medical profession from which jewish and communist doctors were soon purged during the s the nazi party carried out a campaign of propaganda in favour of euthanasia the national socialist racial and political office nsrpa produced leaflets posters and short films to be shown in cinemas pointing out to germans the cost of maintaining asylums for the incurably ill and insane these films included the inheritance das erbe the victim of the past opfer der vergangenheit which was given a major premiere in berlin and was shown in all german cinemas and i accuse ich klage an which was based on a novel by dr hellmuth unger a consultant for the child euthanasia program catholic institutions which could be expected to resist the killing of their patients were progressively closed and their inmates transferred to alreadyovercrowded state institutions there the squalid conditions provided further ammunition for campaigns in favour of euthanasia citation needed killing of children edit main article child euthanasia in nazi germany schonbrunn psychiatric hospital photo by ss photographer friedrich franz bauer viktor brack organiser of the t programme extermination centres were established at six existing psychiatric hospitals bernburg brandenburg grafeneck hadamar hartheim and sonnenstein they played a crucial role in developments leading to the holocaust in mid the parents of a severely deformed child identified in as gerhard kretschmar born near leipzig wrote to hitler seeking his permission for their child to be put to death hitler approved this and authorized the creation of the reich committee for the scientific registering of serious hereditary and congenital illnesses reichsausschuss zur wissenschaftlichen erfassung erb und anlagebedingter schwerer leiden headed by karl brandt his personal physician and administered by herbert linden of the interior ministry and ss oberfuhrer viktor brack brandt and bouhler were authorized to approve applications to kill children in similar circumstances though bouhler left the details to subordinates such as brack and sa oberfuhrer werner blankenburg this precedent was used to establish a programme of killing children with severe disabilities the guardian consent element soon disappeared from august the interior ministry began registering children with disabilities requiring doctors and midwives to report all cases of newborns with severe disabilities those to be killed were identified as all children under three years of age in whom any of the following serious hereditary diseases were suspected idiocy and down syndrome especially when associated with blindness and deafness microcephaly hydrocephaly malformations of all kinds especially of limbs head and spinal column and paralysis including spastic conditions the reports were assessed by a panel of medical experts of whom three were required to give their approval before a child could be killed the ministry used various deceptions to gain consent from parents or guardians particularly in catholic areas where parents were generally uncooperative parents were told that their children were being sent to special sections for children where they would receive improved treatment the children sent to these centres were kept for assessment for a few weeks and then killed by injection of toxic chemicals typically phenol their deaths were recorded as pneumonia autopsies were usually performed and brain samples were taken to be used for medical research this apparently helped to ease the consciences of many of those involved since it gave them the feeling that the children had not died in vain and that the whole programme had a genuine medical purpose once war broke out in september the programme adopted less rigorous standards of assessment and a quicker approval process it expanded to include older children and adolescents the conditions covered also expanded and came to include various borderline or limited impairments in children of different ages culminating in the killing of those designated as juvenile delinquents jewish children could be placed in the net primarily because they were jewish and at one of the institutions a special department was set up for minor jewisharyan halfbreeds at the same time increased pressure was placed on parents to agree to their children being sent away many parents suspected what was really happening especially when it became apparent that institutions for children with disabilities were being systematically cleared of their charges and refused consent the parents were warned that they could lose custody of all their children and if that did not suffice the parents could be threatened with callup for labour duty by more than children had been killed the last child to be killed under action t was richard jenne on may in the childrens ward of the kaufbeuren irsee state hospital in bavaria germany more than three weeks after troops from the us had occupied the town killing of adults edit brandt and bouhler soon developed plans to expand the programme of euthanasia to adults in july they held a meeting attended by dr leonardo conti reich health leader and state secretary for health in the interior ministry and professor werner heyde head of the ss medical department this meeting agreed to arranging a national register of all institutionalised people with mental illnesses or physical disabilities olga benario prestes in later gassed at bernburg euthanasia centre the first adults with disabilities to be killed by the nazi regime were not germans but poles the ss men of einsatzkommando cleared the hospitals and mental asylums of the wartheland a region of western poland which was earmarked for incorporation into germany and resettlement by ethnic germans following the german conquest of poland in the danzig now gdansk area some polish inmates of various institutions were shot while were killed in the gdynia area similar measures were taken in other areas of poland destined for incorporation into germany at posen occupied poznan hundreds of patients were killed by means of carbon monoxide gas in an improvised gas chamber developed by dr albert widmann chief chemist of the german criminal police kripo in december reichsfuhrer of the ss heinrich himmler witnessed one of these gassings ensuring that this invention would later be put to much wider uses the idea of killing useless mental patients soon spread from occupied poland to adjoining areas of germany probably because nazi party and ss officers in these areas were most familiar with what was happening in poland these were also the areas where germans wounded from the polish campaign were expected to be accommodated which created a demand for hospital space the gauleiter of pomerania franz schwedecoburg dispatched patients from five pomeranian hospitals to poland where they were shot the gauleiter of east prussia erich koch likewise had patients killed in all more than germans were killed in this initial wave of killings these were carried out on the initiative of local officials although himmler certainly knew and approved of them bishop jan maria micha kowalski killed at hartheim euthanasia centre the official programme for killing adults with mental or physical disabilities began with a letter from hitler issued in october the letter charged bouhler and brandt with enlarging the authority of certain physicians to be designated by name in such a manner that persons who according to human judgement are incurable can upon a most careful diagnosis of their condition of sickness be accorded a mercy death the letter was backdated to september to provide legality to the killings already carried out and to link the programme more definitely to the war giving it a rationale of wartime necessity this letter which provided the sole legal basis for the programme was not a formal fuhrer decree which in nazi germany had the force of law hitler deliberately bypassed health minister conti and his department who were held to be insufficiently imbued with national socialist ruthlessness and who might have raised awkward questions about the legality of the programme he entrusted it to his personal agents bouhler and brandt hartheim euthanasia centre where over people were killed the programme was administered by viktor brack and his staff from tiergartenstrae under the guise of the charitable foundation for cure and institutional care and supervised by bouhler and brandt others closely involved included dr herbert linden who had been heavily involved in the childrens programme dr ernstrobert grawitz chief physician of the ss and august becker an ss chemist these officials chose the doctors who were to carry out the operational part of the programme they were chosen for their political reliability professional reputation and known sympathy for radical eugenics they included several who had proved their worth in the childkilling programme such as unger heinze and hermann pfannmuller the new recruits were mostly psychiatrists notably professor carl schneider of heidelberg professor max de crinis of berlin and professor paul nitsche from the sonnenstein state institution heyde became the operational leader of the programme succeeded later by nitsche in early october all hospitals nursing homes oldage homes and sanatoria were required to report all patients who had been institutionalised for five years or more who had been committed as criminally insane who were of non aryan race or who had been diagnosed with any of a list of specified conditions these included schizophrenia epilepsy huntingtons chorea advanced syphilis senile dementia paralysis encephalitis and terminal neurological conditions generally many doctors and administrators assumed that the purpose of the reports was to identify inmates who were capable of being drafted for labour service they tended to overstate the degree of incapacity of their patients to protect them from labour conscription with fatal consequences when some institutions refused to cooperate teams of t doctors or in some cases nazi medical students visited them and compiled their own lists sometimes in a very haphazard and ideologically motivated way at the same time during all jewish patients were removed from institutions and killed as with the child inmates the adult cases were assessed by a panel of experts working at the tiergartenstrae offices the experts were required to make their judgments solely on the basis of the reports rather than on detailed medical histories let alone examinations sometimes they dealt with hundreds of reports at a time on each they marked a meaning death a meaning life or occasionally a meaning that they were unable to decide three death verdicts condemned the person concerned as with reviews of children over time these processes became less rigorous the range of conditions considered unsustainable grew broader and zealous nazis further down the chain of command increasingly made decisions on their own initiative gassing edit at first patients were killed by lethal injection the method established for killing children the method was soon considered too slow and inefficient for killing adults who needed larger doses of increasingly scarce and expensive drugs and were more likely to need restraint hitler recommended to brandt that carbon monoxide gas be used at his trial brandt described this as a major advance in medical history the first gassings took place at brandenburg euthanasia centre in january under the supervision of widmann becker and christian wirth a kripo criminal police officer who was later to play a prominent role in the final solution extermination of the jews viktor brack was head of these operations once the efficacy of this method was established it became standardised and was instituted at a number of centres across germany in addition to brandenburg these included grafeneck castle in badenwurttemberg dead schloss hartheim near linz in austria over dead sonnenstein euthanasia centre in saxony dead bernburg euthanasia centre in saxonyanhalt and hadamar euthanasia centre in hesse dead these centres were also used to kill prisoners transferred from concentration camps in germany and austria patients were transferred from their institutions to the killing centres in buses called the community patients transports service operated by teams of ss men wearing white coats to give an air of medical care to prevent the families and doctors of the patients from tracing them the patients were often first sent to transit centres in major hospitals where they were supposedly assessed they were moved again to special treatment sonderbehandlung centres families were sent letters explaining that owing to wartime regulations it was not possible for them to visit relatives in these centres most of these patients were killed within hours of arriving at the centres and their bodies cremated for every person killed a death certificate was prepared giving a false but plausible cause of death this was sent to the family along with an urn of ashes random ashes since the victims were cremated en masse the preparation of thousands of falsified death certificates took up most of the working day of the doctors who operated the centres during the centres at brandenburg grafeneck and hartheim killed nearly people each while another were killed at sonnenstein in all about people were killed in t operations that year operations at brandenburg and grafeneck were wound up at the end of the year partly because the areas they served had been cleared and partly because of public opposition in however the centres at bernburg and sonnenstein increased their operations while hartheim where wirth and franz stangl were successively commandants continued as before as a result another people were killed before august when the t programme was officially shut down by hitler even after that date however the centres continued to be used to kill concentration camp inmates eventually some people in this category were killed in the austrianborn journalist gitta sereny conducted a series of interviews with franz stangl who was in prison in dusseldorf after having been convicted of coresponsibility for killing people as commandant of the sobibor and treblinka extermination camps in poland stangl gave sereny a detailed account of the operations of the t programme based on his time as commandant of the killing facility at the hartheim institute he described how the inmates of various asylums were removed and transported by bus to hartheim some were in no mental state to know what was happening to them but many were perfectly sane and for them various forms of deception were used they were told they were at a special clinic where they would receive improved treatment and were given a brief medical examination on arrival they were induced to enter what appeared to be a shower block where they were gassed with carbon monoxide this ruse was later used on a much larger scale at the extermination camps technology and personnel transfer edit see also categoryaction t personnel and tgutachter after the official end of the euthanasia programme in the technology developed many of the

klee dokumente zur euthanasie opposition edit a plaque set in the pavement at no tiergartenstrae commemorates the victims of the nazi euthanasia programme gas chamber in hadamar hitler and his aides were aware from the start that a programme of killing large numbers of germans with disabilities would be unpopular with the german public although hitler had a fixed policy of not issuing written instructions for policies relating to what would later be classed by the united nations and other parties as crimes against humanity he made an exception when he provided bouhler and brack with written authority for the t programme in his confidential october letter this was apparently to overcome opposition within the german state bureaucracy the justice minister franz gurtner had to be shown hitlers letter in august to gain his cooperation hitler told bouhler at the outset that the fuhrers chancellery must under no circumstances be seen to be active in this matter he recommended caution in catholic areas which after the annexations of austria and the sudetenland in included nearly half the population of greater germany public opinion could be expected to be hostile in march a confidential report from the sd in austria warned that the killing programme must be implemented with stealth in order to avoid a probable backlash of public opinion during the war opposition persisted within the bureaucracy lothar kreyssig a district judge and member of the confessing church wrote to gurtner protesting that the t programme was illegal since no law or formal decree from hitler had authorised it gurtner replied if you cannot recognise the will of the fuhrer as a source of law then you cannot remain a judge and had kreyssig dismissed in the concordat of between germany and the holy see the catholic church had agreed to withdraw from all political activity in the prospect of statesanctioned mass killing of german citizens had not occurred to the church such a challenge to fundamental christian belief in the sanctity of human life posed a serious dilemma for german catholics in the church had protested in a private memorandum against proposals to pass a law legalising euthanasia this was one reason the law was not enacted citation needed august von galen the bishop of munster accused the government of breaking the law and publicly condemned the policy fr bernhard lichtenberg protested the policy to the nazis chief medical officer the regime took the program underground in january viktor brack commissioned a paper from dr joseph mayer professor of moral theology at the university of paderborn on the likely reactions of the churches in the event of a state euthanasia programme being instituted mayer a longstanding euthanasia advocate reported that the churches would not oppose such a programme if it was seen to be in the national interest brack showed this paper to hitler in july and it may have increased his confidence that the euthanasia programme would be acceptable to german public opinion when gitta sereny interviewed mayer shortly before his death in he denied that he had approved of killing people with disabilities but since no copies of this paper are known to survive this cannot be determined this turned out not to be the case the t programme was the sole example of an action by the nazi regime which provoked largescale public protests it was impossible to keep the t programme secret thousands of doctors nurses and administrators were involved in it and the majority of those killed had families who were actively concerned about their welfare despite the strictest orders to maintain secrecy some of the staff at the killing centres talked about what was going on in some cases families could tell that the causes of death in certificates were false eg when a patient was claimed to have died of appendicitis even though his appendix had been surgically removed some years earlier in other cases several families in the same town would receive death certificates on the same day in the towns where the killing centres were located many people saw the inmates arrive in buses saw the smoke from the crematoria chimneys noticed that no busloads of inmates ever left the killing centres and drew the correct conclusion in hadamar ashes containing human hair rained down on the town in may the frankfurt county court wrote to gurtner describing scenes in hadamar where children shouted in the streets that people were being taken away in buses to be gassed during rumours of what was taking place spread and many germans withdrew their relatives from asylums and sanatoria to care for them at home often with great expense and difficulty in some places doctors and psychiatrists cooperated with families to have patients discharged or if the families could afford it had them transferred to private clinics where the reach of t did not extend other doctors agreed to rediagnose some patients so that they no longer met the t criteria this risked exposure when the nazi zealots from berlin conducted inspections in kiel professor hans gerhard creutzfeldt managed to save nearly all of his patients however for the most part doctors cooperated with the programme either from ignorance of its true nature agreement with nazi eugenicist policies or fear of the regime hans gerhard creutzfeldt in during protest letters were sent to the reich chancellery and the ministry of justice some of them from nazi party members the first open protest against the removal of people from asylums took place at absberg in franconia in february and others followed the sd report on the incident at absberg noted that the removal of residents from the ottilien home has caused a great deal of unpleasantness and described large crowds of catholic townspeople among them party members protesting against the action opposition to the t policy sharpened after the german attack on the soviet union in june because the war in the east produced for the first time largescale german casualties and the hospitals and asylums began to fill up with maimed and disabled young german soldiers rumours began to circulate that these men would also be subject to euthanasia citation needed church action edit during and some protestant churchmen protested privately against t but none made any public comment bishop theophil wurm presiding the evangelicallutheran church in wurttemberg wrote a strong letter to interior minister frick in march on december reinhold sautter supreme church councillor of wurttembergs state church reproached the nazi ministerial councillor eugen stahle for the murders in grafeneck castle stahle retorted with the nazi government opinion that the fifth commandment thou shalt not kill is no commandment of god but a jewish invention and no longer had any validity clemens august graf von galen others who privately protested were the lutheran theologian friedrich von bodelschwingh director of the bethel institution for epileptics at bielefeld and pastor paulgerhard braune director of the hoffnungstal institution near berlin both used their connections with the regime to negotiate exemptions for their institutions bodelschwingh negotiated directly with brandt and indirectly with hermann goring whose cousin was a prominent psychiatrist braune had meetings with justice minister gurtner who was always dubious about the legality of the programme gurtner later wrote a strongly worded letter to hitler protesting against it hitler did not read it but was told about it by lammers in general the leaders of the protestant church were more enmeshed with the nazi regime than was the case for catholics and they were unwilling to criticise its actions the catholic church which since had pursued a policy of avoiding confrontation with the nazi regime in the hope of preserving its core institutions became increasingly unable to keep silent in the face of mounting evidence about the killing of inmates of hospitals and asylums leading catholic churchmen led by cardinal michael von faulhaber of munich wrote privately to the government protesting against the policy in july the church broke its silence when a pastoral letter from the bishops was read out in all churches declaring that it was wrong to kill except in selfdefence or in a morally justified war this emboldened catholics to make more outspoken protests a few weeks after the pastoral letter was read out the catholic bishop of munster in westphalia clemens august graf von galen publicly denounced the t programme in a sermon he telegrammed his text to hitler calling on the fuhrer to defend the people against the gestapo it is a terrible unjust and catastrophic thing when man opposes his will to the will of god galen said we are talking about men and women our compatriots our brothers and sisters poor unproductive people if you wish but does this mean that they have lost their right to live historian robert lifton says of this sermon this powerful populist sermon was immediately reproduced and distributed throughout germany indeed it was dropped among german troops by british royal air force pilots galens sermon probably had a greater impact than any other statement in consolidating antieuthanasia sentiment another bishop franz bornewasser of trier also sent protests to hitler though not publicly in august galen was even more outspoken broadening his attack to include the nazi persecution of religious orders and the closing of catholic institutions he attributed the heavy allied bombing of westphalian towns to the wrath of god against germany for breaking his laws galens sermons were not reported in the german press but were widely circulated in the form of illegally printed leaflets local nazis asked for galen to be arrested but goebbels told hitler that such action would provoke open revolt in westphalia by august the protests had spread to bavaria according to gitta sereny hitler was jeered by an angry crowd at hof the only time he was opposed in public during his years of rule despite his private fury hitler knew that he could not afford a confrontation with the church at a time when germany was engaged in a lifeanddeath war a belief which was reinforced by the advice of goebbels martin bormann head of the party chancellery and ss leader heinrich himmler robert lifton writes nazi leaders faced the prospect of either having to imprison prominent highly admired clergymen and other protesters a course with consequences in terms of adverse public reaction they greatly feared or else end the programme himmler said if operation t had been entrusted to the ss things would have happened differently because when the fuhrer entrusts us with a job we know how to deal with it correctly without causing useless uproar among the people on august hitler ordered the cancellation of the t programme he issued strict instructions to the gauleiters to avoid further provocations of the churches for the duration of the war the invasion of the soviet union in june provided new opportunities to use the t personnel many were transferred to the east to begin work on a vastly greater programme of killing the final solution of the jewish question the windingup of the t programme did not end the killing of people with disabilities from the end of the killing

edit odilo globocnik was born on april into a germanised slavic family from trzic neumarktl in the imperial free city of trieste then the capital of the austrian littoral administrative region of the austrohungarian empire now in italy he was the second child of franz globocnik also known as globotschnig a cavalry lieutenant in the austrohungarian army who came from a germanspeaking slovene family from the upper carniolan town of trzic german neumarktl now in slovenia his father was unable to accumulate the money needed to get an officers marriage permission and had to leave the service as was the practice at this time he was given a job in the imperial and royal mail his mother anna nee petschinka was born in a mixed czech banat swabian family in vrsac then kingdom of hungary now in serbia in the family left trieste for cseklesz where franz globocnik was recalled to active duty after the outbreak of the first world war the same year odilo globocnik joined the army via a military school the war ended his military education prematurely odilo and his family moved to klagenfurt in carinthia there he joined as a teenager the proaustrian volunteer militia fighting the slovene volunteers and later the yugoslav army during the carinthian war in he worked as an underground propagandist for the austrian cause during the carinthian plebiscite he later enrolled at the hohere staatsgewerbeschule a higher vocational school for mechanical engineering where he passed his matura the austrian equivalent of the german abitur and graduated with honours he performed jobs such as carrying suitcases at the railway station in order to help support the family financially globocnik first appeared in politics in when he became a prominent member of prenazi carinthian paramilitary organisations and was seen wearing a swastika at the time he was a building tradesman introduced to this while engaged to grete michner her father emil michner talked to the director of kaewag a hydropower plant and secured globocnik a job as a technician and construction supervisor nazi career edit gauleiter of vienna in august globocnik was arrested for the first time for attempting to contact imprisoned nazis in klagenfurt this was also the same year that he became a member of the austrian ss he was arrested because of his public support for the national socialist german workers party nsdap commonly known as the nazi party as he had become a member of the nazi party three years earlier in while in carinthia although he was arrested four times between and he spent little over a year in jail this was due to heinrich himmler s intervention after two years of arguments between globocnik and the authorities his first documented activity for the nsdap occurred in when his name appeared in documents relating to the spreading of propaganda for the party by this point he had more or less abandoned his career as a building tradesman and attached himself very closely to the nsdap one of his tasks for the nsdap was to construct a courier and intelligence service which channeled funds from the german reich into austria globocnik was inducted into the ss on september with the number in june in vienna a bomb was thrown at the shop of jewish jeweller norbert futterweit killing him this was one of the first murders in austria attributable to the nazis and a number of historians believe that globocnik was involved in the attack his fanatical devotion to the nazi cause paid off for globocnik as he quickly climbed the ladder of the party apparatus in his native austria he became a deputy gauleiter for the whole of the country in at the age of and was a key player in the usurpation of the austrian government by the national socialists the anschluss saw the annexation of austria by nazi germany in early globocnik was rewarded for his diligence being appointed gauleiter of vienna on may by adolf hitler while gauleiter of vienna globocnik spread antisemitic propaganda in his early tenure as gauleiter globocnik espoused nazi antijewish philosophy i will not recoil from radical interventions for the solution of jewish questions later that same year he opened viennas first antisemitic political exhibition which was attended by visitors on the first day prominent at the exhibition and received enthusiastically by the public was the film the eternal jew austria was overwhelmingly catholic but globocnik was fanatically anticatholic early gestures of accommodation to the new government by cardinal innitzer did not assuage the austrian nazi radicals foremost among them the young gauleiter globocnik he launched a crusade against the church and the nazis confiscated property closed catholic organisations and sent many priests to dachau anger at the treatment of the church in austria grew quickly and october saw the first act of overt mass resistance to the new regime when a rally of thousands left mass in vienna chanting christ is our fuhrer before being dispersed by police a nazi mob ransacked cardinal innitzers residence after he denounced nazi persecution of the church as corrupt as he was fanatical gauleiter globocnik was relieved of his post and stripped of his party honours in when it was discovered that he was involved in illegal foreign currency speculation as punishment himmler transferred globocnik to the waffen ss in the rank of corporal where he served with ss standarte germania during the polish campaign himmler liked globocnik and recognised the value of the ruthless austrian in late globocnik was pardoned promoted to ssbrigadefuhrer and assigned to lublin province service in occupied poland edit on november himmler appointed globocnik ss and police leader in the lublin district of the general government territory after the initially disappointing party career globocnik now had a second chance in the ranks of the ss and the police on february globocnik declared the evacuated jews should feed themselves and be supported by their countrymen as these jews have enough food if this does not succeed one should let them starve in the years that followed globocnik was responsible for liquidating the warsaw ghetto which contained about jews the largest jewish community in europe and the second largest in the world after new york liquidating the bialystok ghetto which stood out for its strong resistance to german occupation resettling a large number of poles under the premise of ethnic cleansing implementation and supervision of the lublin reservation to which jews were deported with its adjacent network of forced labour camps in the lublin district he was also in charge of over jewish labourers extermination camps edit action t bus for gassing from hartheim euthanasia centre there are indications that globocnik may have been the originator of the extermination camp industrialised murder concept and the one who suggested it to himmler at a twohour meeting with himmler on october globocnik received verbal approval to start construction work on the belzec extermination camp the first such camp in the general government shortly beforehand in september globocnik had been visited by phillip bouhler and victor brack the top officials in the fuhrer chancellery responsible for the action t euthanasia program which had been using gas chambers disguised as shower rooms to execute many of its victims on or about october globocnik had written a memorandum to himmler containing proposals for actions against the jews of a security policy nature and the october meeting was held to discuss this memorandum and related subjects a colleagues contemporaneous letter reflects globocniks state of mind at the time of the october meeting globocnik then considered it necessary to undertake a cleansing of the entire general government of jews and poles and was full of good and farreaching plans to accomplish this there are even indications that globocnik may have begun a crude experimental gassing facility in the woods near belzec shortly before his midoctober meeting with himmler globocnik at the october meeting proposed exterminating the jews in assemblyline fashion in a concentration camp utilising gas chambers on october the day after he had met with globocnik himmler held a fivehour meeting with reinhard heydrich to discuss executions following which there was a proliferation of other extermination camp gassing sites days later himmler forbade all further jewish emigration from reich territory in view of the forthcoming final solution to the jewish question the gassing facilities that globocnik established at belzec soon after his october meeting with himmler used carbon monoxide as the t programme had done and were designed by t programme veterans assigned to globocnik before it became an extermination camp belzec had been part of himmlers and globocniks burggraben project the construction of three more camps sobibor and maidanek in the lublin district and treblinka at makinia gorna followed in globocnik was complicit in the extermination of more than million polish czech dutch french russian slovak german portuguese turkish spanish and austrian jews as well as a smaller number of nonjews in the death camps which he organised and supervised he exploited jews and nonjews as slave labourers in his own forced labour camps and was responsible for seizing the properties and valuables of murdered inmates while in charge of operation reinhard although other arms of the nazi state were also involved in the overall management of the greater concentration camp system globocnik had control over the aktion reinhard camps and any orders that he received came directly from himmler from he also oversaw the beginning of the generalplan ost the plan to expel poles from their lands and resettle those territories with german settlers see zamosc uprising takeover of italy edit after the german takeover of italy due to its total capitulation at cassibile globocnik was appointed higher ss and police leader of the operational zone of the adriatic littoral of italy after the completion of operation reinhard in poland he was sent to trieste his hometown with him he brought to trieste a large number of experienced killers who had distinguished records from various extermination operations in germany the soviet union and the death camps in occupied poland at belzec sobibor and treblinka they included the specialists of einsatzkommando reinhard many of whom were ukrainian ss troops male and female einsatzkommando reinhard was divided into three geographical areas the headquarters for each of which was officially denoted with a variation of the letter r r for trieste r for udine and r for fiume having looted some of the german assets stolen from holocaust victims at death camps in occupied poland globocnik went to italy with a number of his men who had taken part in aktion tiergarten including franz stangl from treblinka and franz reichleitner a few days after september christian wirth arrived in trieste together they converted an old rice mill at the outskirts of trieste into a detention centre complete with a crematorium known as risiera di san sabba in slovene rizarna at san sabba thousands of italian jews partisans and other political dissidents were interrogated tortured and murdered by them after the downfall of benito mussolini and the german takeover of the country in slovene littoral slovene partisans were fought both by germans and by littoral home guard which was also under globocniks direct command and provided germans with lists of locations of liberation front of the slovene nation hideouts and suspicious individuals described as propagandists retreat and death edit with the advance of allied troops globocnik retreated into austrian carinthia and finally went into hiding high in the mountains in an alpine hut near weissensee still in company of his closest staff members globocnik was tracked down and captured by a british armoured cavalry unit the th queens own hussars at the moslacher alm overlooking the weissensee on may globocnik was taken to paternion to be interrogated and at around hours committed suicide by biting on a cyanide capsule at least two contemporary photographs show globocniks body shortly after his death and there are several reliable reports including the regimental diary and field reports of the th queens own hussars detailing the circumstances of his capture and suicide captured with him were seven men including georg michalsen friedrich rainer ernst lerch hermann hofle karl hellesberger hugo herzog and friedrich plob his body was taken to be buried in a local churchyard but the priest reportedly refused to have the body of such a man resting in consecrated ground a grave was dug outside the churchyard next to an outer wall and the body was buried without ceremony urban legends edit prior to the s there was debate over the circumstances of globocniks survival some had speculated that his death in either early may or june was at the hands of either partisans or a jewish revenge squad a false version of globocniks fate has circulated indicating that he was turned over to us intelligence by the british this is based on an official us document signed by us cic sa operations officer andrew l venters dated october more than three years after his supposed death however this document was exposed as a forgery in the s by the investigative writer and historian gitta sereny she gives all details in a long article in the observer newspaper in popular culture edit globocnik features as a major character in the alternate history fatherland by robert harris in the novel which revolves around the notion that germany had been victorious in the second world war globocnik commonly referred to by his nickname globus has risen to become a feared leader within the gestapo globocnik is the main villain in the story john shrapnel plays him in the tv film of the novel there is also a minor character in harry turtledove s novel in the presence of mine enemies with the name odilo globocnik however the chronology of the story set around the year in an alternate history of nazi germany means that this character cannot be the same person as the real globocnik turtledoves character is described as being in his fifties and thus would have been born sometime in the s the historical globocnik born in would have been over one hundred years old at the time in which the novel is set it is unknown whether the globocnik described in the novel is related to the real globocnik globocnik appears as an affable yet threatening and suspicious bureaucrat in jonathan littell s novel the kindly ones see also edit ernst lerch

laborers from one of globocniks lublin camps whence the prisoners returned each night later the workforce included red army pows who had to survive extreme conditions including sleeping out in the open by midnovember only of them were still alive of which at least were incapable of further labor in middecember barracks for were ready when a typhus epidemic broke out and by january all the forced laborers pows as well as polish jews were dead all work ceased until march when new prisoners arrived although the camp did eventually have the capacity to hold approximately prisoners it did not grow significantly beyond that size in operation edit aerial reconnaissance photograph of the majdanek concentration camp june from the collections of the majdanek museum lower half the barracks

treblinka the three camps built specifically for operation reinhard to eliminate polish jewry cf solution of the jewish question in the five districts of occupied poland that constituted the nazi generalgouvernement those camps had begun operations in march may and july respectively of that year subsequently himmler issued an order that the deportation of jews to the camps be completed by the end of majdanek was made into a secondary sorting and storage depot at the onset of operation reinhard for property and valuables taken from the victims at the killing centers in belzec sobibor and treblinka however due to large jewish populations in southeastern poland including krakow lwow zamosc and warsaw which were not yet processed majdanek was refurbished as a killing center around march the gassing was performed in plain view of other inmates without as much as a fence around the buildings another popular killing method was execution by the squads of trawnikis according to the majdanek museum the gas chambers began operation in september executions were committed via either zyklon b or asphyxiation by fumes from captured soviet tank engines due to the pressing need for foreign manpower in the war industry the jewish laborers from poland were originally spared and were for a time either kept in the ghettos such as the one in warsaw which became a concentration camp after the warsaw ghetto uprising or sent to labor camps such as majdanek where they worked primarily at the steyrdaimlerpuch weaponsmunitions factory crematorium red army soldiers examining the ovens

and were nonjewish poles minority contingents included belarusians ukrainians russians germans austrians slovenes italians and french and dutch nationals according to the data from the official majdanek state museum persons were inmates of the camp at one time or another the prisoner population at any given time was much lower from october onwards majdanek also had female overseers these ss

elisabeth knoblichernst charlotte karla mayerwoellert and gertrud heise majdanek did not initially have subcamps these were incorporated in early autumn when the remaining forced labor camps around lublin including budzyn trawniki poniatowa krasnik pulawy as well as the airstrip and lipowa concentration camps became subcamps of majdanek from september to may alfons bentele headed the administration in the camp of majdanek alois kurz ss untersturmfuhrer was a crew member of the german concentration camp majdanek auschwitzbirkenau and mittelbaudora who was not charged on june fritz ritterbusch moved to kl lublin to become aidedecamp to the commandant due to the camps proximity to lublin prisoners were able to communicate with the outside world through letters smuggled out by civilian workers who entered the camp many of these surviving letters have been donated by their recipients to the camp museum in the museum held a special exhibition displaying a selection of those letters from february onwards the germans allowed the polish red cross and central welfare council to bring in food for the prisoners to the camp prisoners could also receive food packages via the polish red cross addressed to them by name the majdanek museum archives document prisoners that received such packages aktion erntefest edit operation reinhard continued until early november when the last generalgouvernement jews were exterminated as part of operation harvest festival with respect to majdanek the most notorious of this wave of executions occurred on november when jews were killed on a single day on november jews who had succeeded in hiding during the killings of the day before were found and executed another prisoners women and men were commanded to sort through the clothes and remains of the dead the men were at first commanded to bury the dead but were later assigned to sonderkommando where they had to exhume the same bodies for cremation the men were then themselves executed the women were subsequently sent to auschwitz where they were gassed by the end of operation harvest festival majdanek had only jews left out of a total of prisoners executions of the remaining prisoners continued at majdanek in the following months between december and march majdanek received approximately socalled invalids many of whom where subsequently gassed with zyklon b executions by firing squad continued as well with shot on january shot on january and shot on march adjutant karl hoeckers trial reveals his culpability in mass murders committed at this camp on may a district court in the germany city of bielefeld sentenced hocker to four years imprisonment for his involvement in gassing to death prisoners primarily polish jews in the concentration camp majdanek in poland camp records showed that between may and may hocker had acquired at least kilograms lb of zyklon b poisonous gas for use in majdanek from the hamburg firm of tesch amp stabenow in addition commandant rudolf hoss of auschwitz wrote in his memoirs penned while awaiting trial in poland that one method of murder used at majdanek kz lublin was zyklonb in late july with soviet forces rapidly approached lublin the germans hastily evacuated the camp however the staff had only succeeded in partially destroying the crematoria before soviet red army troops arrived on july making majdanek the bestpreserved camp of the holocaust it was the first major concentration camp liberated by allied forces and the horrors found there were widely publicised although inmates had previously been forcibly marched to auschwitz of whom only half arrived alive the red army still found thousands of inmates mainly pows still in the camp and ample evidence of the mass murder that had occurred there death toll edit cylinders for poison gas that was fed to fake shower rooms at the camp the total number of victims is controversial beginning with the research of judge zdzisaw ukaszkiewicz dating back to who gave the figure of victims it was followed by estimation of around victims by dr czesaw rajca from the majdanek museum which was cited by the museum for years the most recent figure was given in by tomasz kranz director of the research department of the state museum at majdanek that number is close to the one currently indicated on the museums website it is considered incredibly low by now retired dr rajca nevertheless it has been accepted by the museum board of directors with a certain caution pending further research into the number of prisoners who were not entered into the holocaust train records by german camp administration as a known fact for now the museum informs that based on new research some prisoners arrived at majdanek during the months of its existence of the more than jewish people killed in the course of operation reinhard some jews known by name were most certainly exterminated at majdanek amongst its almost victims accounted for altogether guard towers along the barbedwire doublefence on the majdanek camp perimeter the soviets initially overestimated the number of deaths claiming at the nuremberg trials in july that there were no fewer than jewish victims and the official soviet count was of million victims of different nationalities independent canadian journalist raymond arthur davies who was based in moscow and on the payroll of the canadian jewish congress visited majdanek on august the following day he sent a telegram to saul hayes the executive director of the canadian jewish congress it states i do wish to stress that majdanek where one million jews and half a million others were killed and you can tell america that at least three million polish jews were killed of whom at least a third were killed in majdanek though this estimate was never taken seriously by scholars in raul hilberg estimated the number of the jewish victims at though at the time other sources including the camp museum officially estimated jewish victims and up to nonjews killed in dr czesaw rajca published his own estimate of it was displayed at the camp museum the research by the head of scientific department at majdanek museum historian tomasz kranz indicated that there were victims of whom were jews the differences in estimates stem from different methods used for estimating and the amounts of evidence available to the researchers the soviet figures relied on the most crude methodology also used to make early auschwitz estimatesit was assumed that the number of victims more or less corresponded to the crematoria capacities later researchers tried to take much more evidence into account using records of deportations and population censuses as well as the nazis own records hilbergs estimate using these records aligns closely with kranzs report the wellpreserved original ovens in the second crematorium at majdanek were built in by heinrich kori they replaced the ovens brought to majdanek from sachsenhausen concentration camp in aftermath edit after the break down of the camp in august the soviets protected the camp area and convened a special polishsoviet commission to investigate and document the crimes against humanity committed at majdanek this effort constitutes one of the first attempts to document the nazi war crimes in eastern europe in the fall of the majdanek state museum was founded on the grounds of the majdanek concentration camp in the actual camp became the monument of martyrology by the decree of polish parliament in the same year some m of surface soil mixed with human ashes and fragments of bones was collected and turned into a large mound majdanek received the status of the national museum in main article majdanek trials some nazi personnel of the camp were prosecuted immediately after the war and some in the decades afterward in november and december four ss men and two kapos were placed on trial one committed suicide and the rest were hanged on december the last major widely publicized prosecution of ss members from majdanek majdanekprozess in german took place from to in west germany however of the ss members who worked at majdanek and are known by name only were prosecuted this was due to a rule applied by the west german justice system that only those directly involved in the murder process could be charged ssstandartenfuhrer karlotto

tokin aka victor tolkin was constructed at the site it consists of two parts a large gate monument at the camps entrance and a large mausoleum holding ashes of the victims at its opposite end in october in cooperation with the majdanek museum four majdanek survivors returned to the site and enabled archaeologists to find some objects which had been buried by inmates including watches earrings and wedding rings according to the documentary film buried prayers this was the largest reported recovery of valuables in a death camp to date interviews between government historians and jewish survivors were not frequent before in december construction work started on a large trade and entertainment complex near lipowa named lindenstrae during the occupation and sklodowskiej streets in

also references further reading external links controversy regarding use of findings experiments according to the indictments at the subsequent nuremberg trials these experiments included the following experiments on twins experiments on twin children in concentration camps were created to show the similarities and differences in the genetics of twins as well as to see if the human body can be unnaturally manipulated the central leader of the experiments was josef mengele who from to performed experiments on nearly sets of imprisoned twins at auschwitz about people survived these studies the twins were arranged by age and sex and kept in barracks between experiments which ranged from injection of different dyes into the eyes of twins to see whether it would change their color to sewing twins together in attempts to create conjoined twins bone muscle and nerve transplantation experiments from about september to about december experiments were conducted at the ravensbruck concentration camp for the benefit of the german armed forces to study bone muscle and nerve regeneration and bone transplantation from one person to another citation needed sections of bones muscles and nerves were removed from the subjects without use of anesthesia as a result of these operations many victims suffered intense agony mutilation and permanent disability head injury experiments in mid in baranowicze occupied poland experiments were conducted in a small building behind the private home occupied by a known nazi sd security service officer in which a young boy of eleven or twelve was strapped to a chair so he could not move above him was a mechanized hammer that every few seconds came down upon his head the boy was driven insane from the torture freezing experiments a cold water immersion experiment at dachau concentration camp presided over by professor ernst holzlohner left and dr sigmund rascher right the subject is wearing an experimental luftwaffe garment in the luftwaffe conducted experiments with the intent of discovering means to prevent and treat hypothermia there were to experiments and to victims indicating some victims suffered more than one experiment

effects of cold exposure the experimenters also assessed different methods of rewarming survivors one assistant later testified that some victims were thrown into boiling water for rewarming the freezing hypothermia experiments were conducted for the nazi high command to simulate the conditions the armies suffered on the eastern front as the german forces were illprepared for the cold weather they encountered many experiments were conducted on captured russian troops the nazis wondered whether their genetics gave them superior resistance to cold the principal locales were dachau and auschwitz dr sigmund rascher an ss doctor based at dachau reported directly to reichsfuhrerss heinrich himmler and publicised the results of his freezing experiments at the medical conference entitled medical problems arising from sea and winter approximately people are reported to have died as a result of these experiments malaria experiments from about february to about april experiments were conducted at the dachau concentration camp in order to investigate immunization for treatment of malaria healthy inmates were infected by mosquitoes or by injections of extracts of the mucous glands of female mosquitoes after contracting the disease the subjects were treated with various drugs to test their relative efficiency over people were used in these experiments and more than half died as a result citation needed immunization experiments at the german concentration camps of sachsenhausen dachau natzweiler buchenwald and neuengamme scientists tested immunization compounds and serums for the prevention and treatment of contagious diseases including malaria typhus tuberculosis typhoid fever yellow fever and infectious hepatitis mustard gas experiments at various times between september and april many experiments were conducted at sachsenhausen natzweiler and other camps to investigate the most effective treatment of wounds caused by mustard gas test subjects were deliberately exposed to mustard gas and other vesicants eg lewisite which inflicted severe chemical burns the victims wounds were then tested to find the most effective treatment for the mustard gas burns child victims of nazi experimentation show incisions where axillary lymph nodes had been surgically removed after they were deliberately infected with tuberculosis at neuengamme concentration camp they were later executed citation needed sulfonamide experiments from about july to about september experiments to investigate the effectiveness of sulfonamide a synthetic antimicrobial agent were conducted at ravensbruck wounds inflicted on the subjects were infected with bacteria such as streptococcus clostridium perfringens the causative agent in gas gangrene and clostridium tetani the causative agent in tetanus circulation of blood was interrupted by tying off blood vessels at both ends of the wound to create a condition similar to that of a battlefield wound infection was aggravated by forcing wood shavings and ground glass into the wounds the infection was treated with sulfonamide and other drugs to determine their effectiveness sea water experiments from about july to about september experiments were conducted at the dachau concentration camp to study various methods of making sea water drinkable at one point a group of roughly roma were deprived of food and given nothing but sea water to drink by dr hans eppinger leaving them gravely injured they were so dehydrated that others observed them licking freshly mopped floors in an attempt to get drinkable water sterilization experiments the law for the prevention of genetically defective progeny was passed on july which legalized the involuntary sterilization of persons with diseases claimed to be hereditary weakmindedness schizophrenia alcohol abuse insanity blindness deafness and physical deformities the law was used to encourage growth of the aryan race through the sterilization of persons who fell under the quota of being genetically defective of citizens between the age of to had been sterilized within years of the law passing within years patients had been sterilized from about march to about january sterilization experiments were conducted at auschwitz ravensbruck and other places by dr carl clauberg the purpose of these experiments was to develop a method of sterilization which would be suitable for sterilizing millions of people with a minimum of time and effort these experiments were conducted by means of xray surgery and various drugs thousands of victims were sterilized aside from its experimentation the nazi government sterilized around people as part of its compulsory sterilization program intravenous injections of solutions speculated to contain iodine and silver nitrate were successful but had unwanted side effects such as vaginal bleeding severe abdominal pain and cervical cancer therefore radiation treatment became the favored choice of sterilization specific amounts of exposure to radiation destroyed a persons ability to produce ova or sperm the radiation was administered through deception prisoners were brought into a room and asked to complete forms which took two to three minutes in this time the radiation treatment was administered and unknown to the prisoners they were rendered completely sterile many suffered severe radiation burns experiments with poison somewhere between december and october experiments were conducted at buchenwald to investigate the effect of various poisons the poisons were secretly administered to experimental subjects in their food the victims died as a result of the poison or were killed immediately in order to permit autopsies in september experimental subjects were shot with poisonous bullets suffered torture and often died incendiary bomb experiments from around november to around january experiments were conducted at buchenwald to test the effect of various pharmaceutical preparations on phosphorus burns these burns were inflicted on prisoners using phosphorus material extracted from incendiary bombs high altitude experiments further information hubertus strughold in early prisoners at dachau concentration camp were used by sigmund rascher in experiments to aid german pilots who had to eject at high altitudes a lowpressure chamber containing these prisoners was used to simulate conditions at altitudes of up to m ft it was rumored that rascher performed vivisections on the brains of victims who survived the initial experiment of the subjects died outright and the others were executed aftermath many of the subjects died as a result of the experiments conducted by the nazis while many others were executed after the tests were completed to study the effects post mortem those who survived were often left mutilated suffering permanent disability weakened bodies and mental distress on august the doctors captured by allied forces were put on trial in usa vs karl brandt et al commonly known as the doctors trial at the trial several of the doctors argued in their defense that there was no international law regarding medical experimentation the issue of informed consent had previously been controversial in german medicine in when dr albert neisser infected patients mainly prostitutes with syphilis without their consent despite neissers support from most of the academic community public opinion led by psychiatrist albert moll was against neisser while neisser went on to be fined by the royal disciplinary court moll developed a legally based positivistic contract theory of the patientdoctor relationship that was not adopted into german law eventually the minister for religious educational and medical affairs issued a directive stating that medical interventions other than for diagnosis healing and immunization were excluded under all circumstances if the human subject was a minor or not competent for other reasons or if the subject had not given his or her unambiguous consent after a proper explanation of the possible negative consequences of the intervention though this was not legally binding in response drs leo alexander and andrew conway ivy drafted a tenpoint memorandum entitled permissible medical experiment that went on to be known as the nuremberg code the code calls for such standards as voluntary consent of patients avoidance of unnecessary pain and suffering and that there must be a belief that the experimentation will not end in death or disability the code was not cited in any of the findings against the defendants and never made it into either german or american medical law citation needed modern ethical issues the results of the dachau freezing experiments have been used in some modern research into the treatment of hypothermia with at least publications having referenced the experiments since the second world war this together with the recent use of data from nazi research into the effects of phosgene gas has proven controversial and presents an ethical dilemma for modern physicians who do not agree with the methods used to obtain this data some object on an ethical basis and others have rejected nazi research purely on scientific grounds pointing out methodological inconsistencies in an oftencited review of the dachau hypothermia experiments berger states that the study has all the ingredients of a scientific fraud and that the data cannot advance science or save human lives controversy has also risen from the use of results of biological warfare testing done by the imperial

disability broadly describes an impairment in a persons ability to function caused by changes in various subsystems of the body or to mental health the degree of disability may range from mild to moderate severe or profound a person may also have multiple disabilities disability can be measured objectively observed or subjectively selfreport conditions causing disability are classified by the medical community as inherited genetically transmitted congenital meaning caused by a mothers infection or other disease during pregnancy embryonic or fetal developmental irregularities or by injury during or soon after birth acquired such as conditions caused by illness or injury of unknown origin types of disability may also be categorized in the following way physical disability edit main article physical disability any impairment which limits the physical function of limbs fine bones or gross motor ability is a physical impairment not necessarily a physical disability the social model of disability defines physical disability as manifest when an impairment meets a nonuniversal design or program eg a person who cannot climb stairs may have a physical impairment of the knees when putting stress on them from an elevated position such as with climbing or descending stairs if an elevator were provided or a building had services on the first floor this impairment would not become a disability other physical disabilities include impairments which limit other activities of daily living such as severe sleep disorders a man with an above the knee amputation exercises while wearing a prosthetic leg sensory disability edit further information sensory processing disorder sensory disability is impairment of one of the senses the term is used primarily to refer to vision and hearing impairment but other senses can be impaired vision impairment edit main article vision impairment vision impairment or visual impairment is vision loss of a person to such a degree as to qualify as an additional support need through a significant limitation of visual capability resulting from either disease trauma or congenital or degenerative conditions that cannot be corrected by conventional means such as refractive correction medication or surgery this functional loss of vision is typically defined to manifest with best corrected visual acuity of less than or significant central field defect significant peripheral field defect including homonymous or heteronymous bilateral visual field defect or generalized contraction or constriction of field or reduced peak contrast sensitivity with either of the above conditions hearing impairment edit main article hearing impairment hearing impairment or hard of hearing or deafness refers to conditions in which individuals are fully or partially unable to detect or perceive at least some frequencies of sound which can typically be heard by most people mild hearing loss may sometimes not be considered a disability olfactory and gustatory impairment edit impairment of the sense of smell and taste are commonly associated with aging but can also occur in younger people due to a wide variety of causes further information olfaction disorders of olfaction there are various olfactory disorders anosmia inability to smell dysosmia things do not smell as they should hyperosmia an abnormally acute sense of smell hyposmia decreased ability to smell olfactory reference syndrome psychological disorder which causes patients to imagine they have strong body odor parosmia things smell worse than they should phantosmia hallucinated smell often unpleasant in nature further information taste disorders of taste complete loss of the sense of taste is known as ageusia while dysgeusia is persistent abnormal sense of taste somatosensory impairment edit main article somatosensory disorder insensitivity to stimuli such as touch heat cold and pain are often an adjunct to a more general physical impairment involving neural pathways and is very commonly associated with paralysis in which the motor neural circuits are also affected balance disorder edit main article balance disorder a balance disorder is a disturbance that causes an individual to feel unsteady for example when standing or walking it may be accompanied by symptoms of being giddy woozy or have a sensation of movement spinning or floating balance is the result of several body systems working together the eyes visual system ears vestibular system and the bodys sense of where it is in space proprioception need to be intact the brain which compiles this information needs to be functioning effectively intellectual disability edit main article intellectual disability intellectual disability is a broad concept that ranges from mental retardation to cognitive deficits too mild or too specific as in specific learning disability to qualify as mental retardation intellectual disabilities may appear at any age mental retardation is a subtype of intellectual disability and the term intellectual disability is now preferred by many advocates in most englishspeaking countries mental health and emotional disabilities edit main article mental disorder a mental disorder or mental illness is a psychological or behavioral pattern generally associated with subjective distress or disability that occurs in an individual and perceived by the majority of society as being outside of normal development or cultural expectations the recognition and understanding of mental health conditions has changed over time and across cultures and there are still variations in the definition assessment and classification of mental disorders although standard guideline criteria are widely accepted pervasive developmental disorders edit main article pervasive developmental disorders the diagnostic category of pervasive developmental disorders refers to a group of five developmental disabilities characterized by differences in the development of multiple basic functions including socialization and communication the dsmivtr listed the pervasive developmental disorders as autistic disorder asperger syndrome rett syndrome childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified pddnos the dsm does not describe individual diagnosis of any of the pervasive developmental disorders replacing all of them with a unified diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder the icd also includes the diagnosis of overactive disorder associated with mental retardation and stereotyped movements developmental disability edit main article developmental disability developmental disability is any disability that results in problems with growth and development although the term is often used as a synonym or euphemism for intellectual disability the term also encompasses many congenital medical conditions that have no mental or intellectual components for example spina bifida nonvisible disabilities edit main article invisible disability several chronic disorders such as diabetes asthma inflammatory bowel disease epilepsy narcolepsy fibromyalgia and some sleep disorders may be counted as nonvisible disabilities as opposed to disabilities which are clearly visible such as those requiring the use of a wheelchair sociology of disability edit main article disability studies museum of disability history buffalo new york terminology edit different terms have been used for people with disabilities in different times and places the euphemism treadmill and changing fashions have caused terms to rise or fall in popularity at this time disability or impairment are commonly used as are more specific terms such as blind to describe having no vision at all or visually impaired to describe having limited vision handicap has been disparaged as a result of false folk etymology that says it is a reference to begging it is actually derived from an old game handicap in which two players trade possessions and a third neutral person judges the difference of value between the possessions the concept of a neutral person evening up the odds was extended to handicap racing in the midth century in handicap racing horses carry different weights based on the umpires estimation of what would make them run equally the use of the term to describe a person with a disabilityby extension from handicap racing a person carrying a heavier burden than normalappeared in the early th century handicap replaced terms that are now considered insulting such as crippled peoplefirst language edit main article peoplefirst language many people would rather be referred to as a person with a disability instead of handicapped cerebral palsy a guide for care at the university of delaware offers the following guidelines impairment is the correct term to use to define a deviation from normal such as not being able to make a muscle move or not being able to control an unwanted movement disability is the term used to define a restriction in the ability to perform a normal activity of daily living which someone of the same age is able to perform for example a threeyearold child who is not able to walk has a disability because a normal threeyearold can walk independently handicap is the term used to describe a child or adult who because of the disability is unable to achieve the normal role in society commensurate with his age and sociocultural milieu as an example a sixteenyearold who is unable to prepare his own meal or care for his own toileting or hygiene needs is handicapped on the other hand a sixteenyearold who can walk only with the assistance of crutches but who attends a regular school and is fully independent in activities of daily living is disabled but not handicapped all disabled people are impaired and all handicapped people are disabled but a person can be impaired and not necessarily be disabled and a person can be disabled without being handicapped the american psychological association style guide states that when identifying a person with an impairment the persons name or pronoun should come first and descriptions of the impairmentdisability should be used so that the impairment is identified but is not modifying the person improper examples are a borderline an obsessivecompulsive man or a mentally ill person more acceptable terminology includes a woman with down syndrome or a man who has schizophrenia it also states that a persons adaptive equipment should be described functionally as something that assists a person not as something that limits a person for example a woman who uses a wheelchair rather than a woman inconfined to a wheelchair a similar kind of peoplefirst terminology is also used in the uk but more often in the form people with impairments such as people with visual impairments however in the uk the term disabled people is generally preferred to people with disabilities it is argued under the social model that while someones impairment for example having a spinal cord injury is an individual property disability is something created by external societal factors such as a lack of wheelchair access to the workplace this distinction between the individual property of impairment and the social property of disability is central to the social model the term disabled people as a political construction is also widely used by international organisations of disabled people such as disabled peoples international dpi the use of peoplefirst terminology has given rise to the use of the acronym pwd to refer to persons or people with disabilities or disability the acronym is frequently used by people with disabilities and advocacy organizations not in citation given masculinity edit according to author daniel j wilson the characteristics of masculinity include strength activeness speed endurance and courage these characteristics are often challenged when faced with a disability and the boy or man must reshape what it means to be masculine for example rather than define being a man through what one can physically do one must redefine it by how one faces the world with a disability and all the obstacles and stereotypes that come with the disability in leonard kriegel s book flying solo he describes his fight with poliomyelitis and the process of accepting his disability in a world that values ablebodiedness he writes i had to learn to be my own hero my own role model which is another way of saying that i had to learn to live with neither heroes nor role models femininity edit some note that women who are disabled face what is called a double disability meaning they must not only deal with the stereotypes and challenges posed by femininity but they must also deal with those posed by being disabled culture also tends to view women as fragile and weaker than men stereotypes which are only heightened when a woman has a disability according to the survey of income and program participation as described in the book gendering disability percent of women participants and percent of men participants without disabilities were employed in comparison of those with a form of disability percent of women and percent of men were employed furthermore the nondisabled women participants were paid approximately four us dollars less per hour than the nondisabled men participants with a disability women were paid approximately less than the nondisabled women participants and the men were paid approximately less than the nondisabled men participants as these results suggest women without disabilities face societal hardships as compared to men disability added to the equation increases the hardships disability and poverty edit die kruppel the cripples pieter bruegel there is a global correlation between disability and poverty produced by a variety of factors disability and poverty may form a vicious circle in which physical barriers make it more difficult to get income which in turn diminishes access to health care and other necessities for a healthy life the world report on disability indicates that half of all disabled people cannot afford health care compared to a third of nondisabled people in countries without public services for adults with disabilities their families may be impoverished disability and disasters edit main article disability and disasters there is limited research knowledge but many anecdotal reports on what happens when disasters impact people with disabilities individuals with disabilities are greatly affected by disasters those with physical disabilities can be at risk when evacuating if assistance is not available individuals with cognitive impairments may struggle with understanding instructions that must be followed in the event a disaster occurs those who are blind hearing impaired etc may have difficulty communicating during the emergency all of these factors can increase the degree of variation of risk in disaster situations with disabled individuals research studies have consistently found discrimination against individuals with disabilities during all phases of the disaster cycle the most common limitation is that people cannot physically access buildings or transportation as well as access disasterrelated services the exclusion of these individuals is caused in part by the lack of disabilityrelated training provided to emergency planners and disaster relief personnel theory edit the international classification of functioning disability and health icf produced by the world health organization distinguishes between body functions physiological or psychological such as vision and body structures anatomical parts such as the eye and related structures impairment in bodily structure or function is defined as involving an anomaly defect loss or other significant deviation from certain generally accepted population standards which may fluctuate over time activity is defined as the execution of a task or action the icf lists broad domains of functioning which can be affected learning and applying knowledge general tasks and demands communication basic physical mobility domestic life and selfcare for example activities of daily living interpersonal interactions and relationships community social and civic life including employment other major life areas in concert with disability scholars the introduction to the icf states that a variety of conceptual models has been proposed to understand and explain disability and functioning which it seeks to integrate these models include the following the medical model edit main article medical model of disability the medical model views disability as a problem of the person directly caused by disease trauma or other health conditions which therefore requires sustained medical care in the form of individual treatment by professionals in the medical model management of the disability is aimed at a cure or the individuals adjustment and behavioral change that would lead to an almostcure or effective cure in the medical model medical care is viewed as the main issue and at the political level the principal response is that of modifying or reforming healthcare policy the social model edit main article social model of disability the social model of disability sees the issue of disability as a socially created problem and a matter of the full integration of individuals into society in this model disability is not an attribute of an individual but rather a complex collection of conditions many of which are created by the social environment hence the management of the problem requires social action and it is the collective responsibility of society at large to make the environmental modifications necessary for the full participation of people with disabilities in all areas of social life the issue is both cultural and ideological requiring individual community and largescale social change from this perspective equal access for someone with an impairmentdisability is a human rights issue of major concern some says that medical humanities is a fruitful field where the gap between the medical and the social model of disability might be bridged recently the social model of disability has come under criticism while recognizing the importance played by the social model in stressing the responsibility of society many scholars especially tom shakespeare point out the many limits of the model and urge the need for a new model that will overcome the medical vs social dichotomy other models edit the spectrum model refers to the range of visibility audibility and sensibility under which people function the model asserts that disability does not necessarily mean reduced spectrum of operations rather disability is often defined according to thresholds set on a continuum of disability the moral model refers to the attitude that people are morally responsible for their own disability for example disability may be seen as a result of bad actions of parents if congenital or as a result of practicing witchcraft if not echoes of this can be seen in the doctrine of karma in indian religions it also includes notions that a disability gives a person special abilities to perceive reflect transcend be spiritual the expertprofessional model has provided a traditional response to disability issues and can be seen as an offshoot of the medical model within its framework professionals follow a process of identifying the impairment and its limitations using the medical model and taking the necessary action to improve the position of the disabled person this has tended to produce a system in which an authoritarian overactive service provider prescribes and acts for a passive client the tragedycharity model depicts disabled people as victims of circumstance who are deserving of pity this along with the medical model are the models most used by nondisabled people to define and explain disability the legitimacy model views disability as a valuebased determination about which explanations for the atypical are legitimate for membership in the disability category this viewpoint allows for multiple explanations and models to be considered as purposive and viable the social adapted model states although a persons disability poses some limitations in an ablebodied society often the surrounding society and environment are more limiting than the disability itself the economic model defines disability in terms of reduced ability to work the related loss of productivity and economic effects on the individual employer and society in general this model is directly related to the charitytragedy model citation needed the empowering model also customer model allows for the person with a disability and hisher family to decide the course of their treatment and what services they wish to benefit from this in turn turns the professional into a service provider whose role is to offer guidance and carry out the clients decisions this model empowers the individual to pursue hisher own goals the market model of disability is minority rights and consumerist model of disability that recognizing people with disabilities and their stakeholders as representing a large group of consumers employees and voters this model looks to personal identity to define disability and empowers people to chart their own destiny in everyday life with a particular focus on economic empowerment by this model based on us census data there are billion people in the world who consider themselves to have a disability an additional two billion people are considered stakeholders in disability familyfriendsemployers and when combined to the number of people without disabilities represents of the population citation needed this model states that due to the size of the demographic companies and governments will serve the desires pushed by demand as the message becomes prevalent in the cultural mainstream the consumer model of disability is based upon the rightsbased model and claims that people with disabilities should have equal rights and access to products goods and services offered by businesses the consumer model extends the rightsbased model by proposing that businesses not only accommodate customers with disabilities under the requirements of legislation but that businesses actively seek market to welcome and fully engage people with disabilities in all aspects of business service activities the model suggests that all business operations for example websites policies and procedures mission statements emergency plans programs and services should integrate access and inclusion practices furthermore these access and inclusion practices should be based on established customer service access and inclusion standards that embrace and support the active engagement of people of all abilities in business offerings management edit assistive technology edit main article assistive technology assistive technology is a generic term for devices and modifications for a person or within a society that help overcome or remove a disability the first recorded example of the use of a prosthesis dates to at least bc the wheelchair dates from the th century the curb cut is a related structural innovation other examples are standing frames text telephones accessible keyboards large print braille amp speech recognition software people with disabilities often develop personal or community adaptations such as strategies to suppress tics in public for example in tourettes syndrome or sign language in deaf communities as the personal computer has become more ubiquitous various organizations have formed to develop software and hardware to make computers more accessible for people with disabilities some software and hardware such as voice finger freedom scientific s jaws the free and open source alternative orca etc have been specifically designed for people with disabilities while other software and hardware such as nuance s dragon naturallyspeaking were not developed specifically for people with disabilities but can be used to increase accessibility the lomak keyboard was designed in new zealand specifically for persons with disabilities the world wide web consortium recognised a need for international standards for web accessibility for persons with disabilities and created the web accessibility initiative wai as at dec the standard is wcag wcag web content accessibility guidelines adapted sports edit main article disabled sports wheelchair basketball match between south africa and iran at the summer paralympics the paralympic games meaning alongside the olympics are

paralympic sports on levels ranging from recreational to elite for example disabled sports usa and blazesports america in the united states the paralympics developed from a rehabilitation programme

the decade was closed in an address before the general assembly by robert davila both bowe and davila are deaf in unesco accepted sign language for use in education of deaf children and youth demographics edit estimates worldwide edit estimates of worldwide and countrywide numbers of individuals with disabilities are problematic the varying approaches taken to defining disability notwithstanding demographers agree that the world population of individuals with disabilities is very large for example in the world health organization estimated a world population of billion people of those nearly million people or were estimated to be moderately or severely disabled in the united states americans with disabilities constitutes the largest and most inclusive minority according to the us census bureau as of there were some million disabled people or by comparison african americans are the largest racial minority in the us but only constitute of the us population there is widespread agreement among experts who in the field that disability is more common in developing than in developed nations the connection between disability and poverty is thought to be part of a vicious cycle in which these constructs are mutually reinforcing nearly million european men were permanently disabled in world war i about vietnam veterans came home wounded and at least were permanently disabled as of there were million disabled veterans in the united states an increase of percent over after years of war in afghanistan there are more than million disabled people

may vary disability abuse edit main article disability abuse disability abuse is when people are abused physically financially verbally or mentally due to the person having a disability as many disabilities are not visible for example asthma learning disabilities some abusers cannot rationalise the nonphysical disability with a need for understanding support and so on as the prevalence of disability and the cost of supporting disability increases with medical advancement and longevity in general this aspect of society becomes of greater political importance how political parties treat their disabled constituents may become a measure of a political partys understanding of disability particularly in the social measure of disability disability rights movement edit main article

japheth and africa to cham ham early modern depiction of europa regina queen europe and the mythical europa of the th century before christ the use of the term europe has developed gradually throughout history in antiquity the greek historian herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts europe asia and libya africa with the nile and the river phasis forming their boundariesthough he also states that some considered the river don rather than the phasis as the boundary between europe and asia europes eastern frontier was defined in the st century by geographer strabo at the river don the book of jubilees described the continents as the lands given by noah to his three sons europe was defined as stretching from the pillars of hercules at the strait of gibraltar separating it from north africa to the don separating it from asia a cultural definition of europe as the lands of latin christendom coalesced in the th century signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of germanic traditions and christianlatin culture defined partly in contrast with byzantium and islam and limited to northern iberia the british isles france christianized western germany the alpine regions and northern and central italy the concept is one of the lasting legacies of the carolingian renaissance europa often figures in the letters of charlemagnes court scholar alcuin this divisionas much cultural as geographicalwas used until the late middle ages when it was challenged by the age of discovery why the problem of redefining europe was finally resolved in when instead of waterways the swedish geographer and cartographer von strahlenberg proposed the ural mountains as the most significant eastern boundary a suggestion that found favour in russia and throughout europe europe is now generally defined by geographers as the western peninsula of eurasia with its boundaries marked by large bodies of water to the north west and south europes limits to the far east are usually taken to be the urals the ural river and the caspian sea to the southeast including the caucasus mountains the black sea and the waterways connecting the black sea to the mediterranean sea islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass hence iceland is generally considered to be part of europe while the nearby island of greenland is usually assigned to north america nevertheless there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences cyprus is closest to anatolia or asia minor but is usually considered part of europe both culturally and politically and currently is a member state of the eu malta was considered an island of north africa for centuries the geographic boundary drawn between europe and asia in follows no international boundaries as a result attempts to organize europe along political or economic lines have resulted in uses of the name in a geopolitically limiting way to refer only to the member states of the european union conversely europe has also been used in a very expansive way by the council of europe which has member countries some of which territorially overreach the ural and bosphorus lines to include all of russia and turkey in addition people in the british isles may refer to continental or mainland europe as europe etymology europa and the bull on a greek vase tarquinia museum c bc in ancient greek mythology europa was a phoenician princess whom zeus abducted after assuming the form of a dazzling white bull he took her to the island of crete where she gave birth to minos rhadamanthus and sarpedon for homer europe ancientgreek europe see also list of greek place names was a mythological queen of crete not a geographical designation the etymology of europe is uncertain one theory suggests that it is derived from the greek eurus meaning wide broad and ops op opt meaning eye face countenance hence europe widegazing broad of aspect compare with glauk op is greyeyed athena or bo op is oxeyed hera broad has been an epithet of earth itself in the reconstructed protoindoeuropean religion another theory suggests that it is based on a semitic word such as the akkadian erebu meaning to go down set in reference to the sun cognate to phoenician ereb evening west and arabic maghreb hebrew maarav see also erebus pie h regwos darkness however martin litchfield west states that phonologically the match between europas name and any form of the semitic word is very poor whatever the origin of the name of the mythological figure is first used as a geographical term in the th century bc by greek geographers such as anaximander and hecataeus anaximander placed the boundary between asia and europe along the phasis river the modern rioni in the caucasus a convention still followed by herodotus in the th century bc but the convention received by the middle ages and surviving into modern usage is that of the roman era used by roman era authors such as posidonius strabo and ptolemy who took the tanais the modern don river as the boundary the term europe is first used for a cultural sphere in the carolingian renaissance of the th century from that time the term designated the sphere of influence of the western church as opposed to both the eastern orthodox churches and to the islamic world the modern convention enlarging the area of europe somewhat to the east and the southeast develops in the th century most major world languages use words derived from europa to refer to the continent peninsula chinese for example uses the word ouzhou a similar chinesederived term oshu is also sometimes used in japanese such as in the japanese name of the european union oshu rengo despite the katakana yoroppa being more commonly used however in some turkic languages the originally persian name frangistan land of the franks is used casually in referring to much of europe besides official

iberian peninsula the sacking of suzdal by batu khan in during the mongol invasion of europe in the th and th centuries constant incursions by nomadic turkic tribes such as the pechenegs and the cumankipchaks caused a massive migration of slavic populations to the safer heavily forested regions of the north and temporarily halted the expansion of the rus state to the south and east like many

borders consist of the arctic ocean to the north the atlantic ocean to the west and the mediterranean black and caspian seas to the south land relief in europe shows great variation within relatively small areas the southern regions are more mountainous while moving north the terrain descends from the high alps pyrenees and carpathians through hilly uplands into broad low northern plains which are vast in the east this extended lowland is known as the great european plain and at its heart lies the north german plain an arc of uplands also exists along the northwestern seaboard which begins in the western parts of the islands of britain and ireland and then continues along the mountainous fjordcut spine of norway land use map of europe with arable farmland yellow forest dark green pasture light green and tundra or bogs in the north dark yellow this description is simplified subregions such as the iberian peninsula and the italian peninsula contain their own complex features as does mainland central europe itself where the relief contains many plateaus river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend subregions like iceland britain and ireland are special cases the former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of europe while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off climate main article climate of europe biomes of europe and surrounding regions tundra alpine tundra taiga montane forest temperate broadleaf forest mediterranean forest temperate steppe dry steppe europe lies mainly in the temperate climate zones being subjected to prevailing westerlies the climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the gulf stream the gulf stream is nicknamed europes central heating because it makes europes climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be the gulf stream not only carries warm water to europes coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the atlantic ocean therefore the average temperature throughout the year of naples is c f while it is only c f in new york city which is almost on the same latitude berlin germany calgary canada and irkutsk in the asian part of russia lie on around the same latitude january temperatures in berlin average around c f higher than those in calgary and they are almost c f higher than average temperatures in irkutsk similarly northern parts of scotland have a tempertate marine climate the yearly average temperature in city of inverness is degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit however churchill manitoba canada is on roughly the same latitude and has an average temperature of degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit giving it a nearly subarctic climate geology main article geology of europe the geology of europe is hugely varied and complex and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent from the scottish highlands to the rolling plains of hungary mount elbrus is the highest mountain in europe the adriatic sea contains over islands and islets europa point as seen from the strait of gibraltar europes most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous southern europe and a vast partially underwater northern plain ranging from ireland in the west to the ural mountains in the east these two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the pyrenees and alps carpathians the northern plains are delimited in the west by the scandinavian mountains and the mountainous parts of the british isles major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the celtic sea the north sea the baltic sea complex and barents sea the northern plain contains the old geological continent of baltica and so may be regarded geologically as the main continent while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents most of the older geology of western europe existed as part of the ancient microcontinent avalonia geological history main article geological history of europe the geological history of europe traces back to the formation of the baltic shield fennoscandia and the sarmatian craton both around billion years ago followed by the volgouralia shield the three together leading to the east european craton baltica which became a part of the supercontinent columbia around billion years ago baltica and arctica as part of the laurentia block became joined to rodinia later resplitting around million years ago to reform as baltica around million years ago euramerica was formed from baltica and laurentia a further joining with gondwana then leading to the formation of pangea around million years ago gondwana and laurasia split apart due to the widening of the atlantic ocean finally and very soon afterwards laurasia itself split up again into laurentia north america and the eurasian continent the land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time via greenland leading to interchange of animal species from around million years ago rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of europe and its connections with continents such as asia europes present shape dates to the late tertiary period about five million years ago biodiversity see also fauna of europe biogeographic regions of europe and bordering regions having lived sidebyside with agricultural peoples for millennia europes animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man with the exception of fennoscandia and northern russia few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in europe except for various national parks the main natural vegetation cover in europe is mixed forest the conditions for growth are very favourable in the north the gulf stream and north atlantic drift warm the continent southern europe could be described as having a warm but mild climate there are frequent summer droughts in this region mountain ridges also affect the conditions some of these alps pyrenees are oriented eastwest and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior others are oriented southnorth scandinavian mountains dinarides carpathians apennines and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea forests grow well on this side while on the other side the conditions are much less favourable few corners of mainland europe have not been grazed by livestock at some point in time and the cutting down of the preagricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems probably to percent of europe was once covered by forest it stretched from the mediterranean sea to the arctic ocean though over half of europes original forests disappeared through the centuries of deforestation europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest such as the taiga of scandinavia and russia mixed rainforests of the caucasus and the cork oak forests in the western mediterranean during recent times deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted however in many cases monoculture plantations of conifers have replaced the original mixed natural forest because these grow quicker the plantations now cover vast areas of land but offer poorer habitats for many european forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure the amount of natural forest in western europe is just or less in european russia the country with the smallest percentage of forested area is iceland while the most forested country is finland floristic regions of europe and neighbouring areas according to wolfgang frey and rainer losch in temperate europe mixed forest with both broadleaf and coniferous trees dominate the most important species in central and western europe are beech and oak in the north the taiga is a mixed spruce pine birch forest further north within russia and extreme northern scandinavia the taiga gives way to tundra as the arctic is approached in the mediterranean many olive trees have been planted which are very well adapted to its arid climate mediterranean cypress is also widely planted in southern europe the semiarid mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest a narrow eastwest tongue of eurasian grassland the steppe extends eastwards from ukraine and southern russia and ends in hungary and traverses into taiga to the north glaciation during the most recent ice age and the presence of man affected the distribution of european fauna as for the animals in many parts of europe most large animals and top predator species have been hunted to extinction the woolly mammoth was extinct before the end of the neolithic period today wolves carnivores and bears omnivores are endangered once they were found in most parts of europe however deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further by the middle ages the bears habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover today the brown bear lives primarily in the balkan peninsula scandinavia and russia a small number also persist in other countries across europe austria pyrenees etc but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat in addition polar bears may be found on svalbard a norwegian archipelago far north of scandinavia the wolf the second largest predator in europe after the brown bear can be found primarily in central and eastern europe and in the balkans with a handful of packs in pockets of western europe scandinavia spain etc once roaming the great temperate forests of eurasia european bison now live in nature preserves in biaowieza forest on the border between poland and belarus european wild cat foxes especially the red fox jackal and different species of martens hedgehogs different species of reptiles like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes and amphibians different birds owls hawks and other birds of prey important european herbivores are snails larvae fish different birds and mammals like rodents deer and roe deer boars and living in the mountains marmots steinbocks chamois among others a number of insects such as the small tortoiseshell butterfly add to the biodiversity the extinction of the dwarf hippos and dwarf elephants has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the mediterranean sea creatures are also an important part of european flora and fauna the sea flora is mainly phytoplankton important animals that live in european seas are zooplankton molluscs echinoderms different crustaceans squids and octopuses fish dolphins and whales biodiversity is protected in europe

gradually spread throughout europe the industrial revolution started in europe specifically the united kingdom in the late th century and the th century saw western europe industrialise economies were disrupted by world war i but by the beginning of world war ii they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the united states world war ii again damaged much of europes industries the cold war after world war ii the economy of the uk was in a state of ruin and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the s west germany recovered quickly and had doubled production from prewar levels by the s france also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation later on spain under the leadership of franco also recovered and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the s in what is called the spanish miracle the majority of central and eastern european states came under the control of the soviet union and thus were members of the council for mutual economic assistance comecon fall of the berlin wall in the states which retained a freemarket system were given a large amount of aid by the united states under the marshall plan the western states moved to link their economies together providing

speakers in europe they are spoken in central eastern and southeastern europe romance languages are spoken primarily in southwestern europe as well as in romania and moldova in central or eastern europe germanic languages are spoken in northern europe the british isles and some parts of central europe many other languages outside the three main groups exist in europe other indoeuropean languages include the baltic group that is latvian and lithuanian the celtic group that is irish scottish gaelic manx welsh cornish and breton greek armenian and albanian in addition a distinct group

heritage see also notes references further reading external links etymology edit see also netherlands toponymy the netherlands in its entirety is often referred to by the much older designation holland meaning holt land or wood land though nowadays this strictly refers only to north and south holland two of the nations twelve provinces that were created out of the former county of holland this from origin frankish county emerged from the dissolved frisian kingdom and was economically and politically the most important county in the region because of this importance holland often served as a metonym for the entire country referring to the netherlands as holland is an example of pars pro toto and is considered either incorrect or informal depending on the context but is more acceptable when referring to the national football team place names with neder or lage nieder nether or low and nedre are in use in various places in countries where a germanic language is spoken and has in french and latin its respective counterparts in bas or inferior throughout history the low countries or netherlands are indicating in this terminology historically always as a deixis ie in relation to a higher ground that is indicated as upper boven oben superior or haut where the geographical location of the lower region has always been more or less downstream and near the sea the geographical location of the upper region changed over time tremendously the romans made a distinction between the roman provinces of downstream germania inferior nowadays part of belgium and the netherlands and upstream germania superior nowadays part of germany the designation low to refer to the region returns again in the th century duchy of lower lorraine that covered much of the low countries but this time the corresponding upper region is upper lorraine in nowadays northern france the dukes of burgundy who ruled the low countries in the th century used the term les pays de par deca the lands over here for the low countries as opposed to les pays de par dela the lands over there for their original homeland burgundy in nowadays eastcentral france under habsburg rule les pays de par deca developed in pays dembas lands downhere an equally deixic expression in relation to other habsburg possessions in europe this was translated with nederlanden in contemporary dutch official documents however niderlant was in the late middle ages also the region between the meuse and the lower rhine the area known as oberland high country was in this deixic context considered to begin approximately at the nearby higher located cologne in this context the term could by extension also be applied to the whole delta of the schelde meuse and rhine and then would occur in the plural form due to the great importance of the low countries the name was increasingly used specifically for this area and lost its deixic meaning from the midsixteenth century on the low countries or the netherlands was besides flanders probably the most commonly used name the eighty years war divided the low countries into the northern united provinces belgica foederata in latin the federated netherlands and the southern netherlands belgica regia the royal netherlands the low countries today is a designation that includes the countries the netherlands belgium and luxembourg it is used synonymous with the more neutral and geopolitical term benelux history edit main article history of the netherlands prehistory before bc edit the netherlands in bc the netherlands in bc an oak figurine found in willemstad bc the prehistory of the area that is now the netherlands was largely shaped by the sea and the rivers that constantly shifted the lowlying geography the oldest human neanderthal traces in the netherlands were found in higher soils near maastricht from years ago after the end of the ice age various paleolithic groups inhabited the area and around bc mesolithic tribes resided in friesland and drenthe where the oldest canoe in the world was recovered autochthonous huntergatherers from the swifterbant culture are attested from around bc onwards they are strongly linked to rivers and open water and were related to the southern scandinavian erteblle culture bc to the west the same tribes might have built hunting camps to hunt winter game people made the switch to animal husbandry sometime between bc and bc agricultural transformation took place very gradually between bc and bc the farming funnelbeaker culture extended from denmark through northern germany into the northern netherlands and erected the dolmens large stone grave monuments found in drenthe built between bc and bc to the southwest the vlaardingen culture around bc an apparently more primitive culture of huntergatherers survived well into the neolithic period around bc there was a quick and smooth transition from the funnelbeaker farming culture to the paneuropean corded ware pastoralist culture the bell beaker culture was also present in the netherlands that apparently arose out of the corded ware culture copper finds show that there was trade with other areas in europe as natural copper is not found in dutch soil the bronze age probably started somewhere around bc and lasted until around bc the many finds in drenthe of rare and valuable objects suggest that it was a trading centre in the bronze age the bell beaker cultures bc locally developed into the bronze age barbedwire beaker culture bc in the second millennium bc the region was the boundary between the atlantic and nordic horizons roughly divided by the course of the rhine in the north the elp culture c bc to bc was a bronze age archaeological culture having earthenware pottery of low quality as a marker the initial phase was characterised by tumuli bc that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern germany and scandinavia and were apparently related to the tumulus culture bc in central europe this phase was followed by a subsequent change featuring urnfield cremation burial customs bc the southern region became dominated by the hilversum culture bc which apparently inherited cultural ties with britain of the previous barbedwire beaker culture the iron age brought a measure of prosperity iron ore was available throughout the country including bog iron extracted from the ore in peat bogs in the north the natural ironbearing balls found in the veluwe and the red iron ore near the rivers in brabant smiths travelled from small settlement to settlement with bronze and iron fabricating tools on demand including axes knives pins arrowheads and swords some evidence even suggests the making of damascus steel swords using an advanced method of forging that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel the kings grave of oss dating from around bc was found in a burial mound the largest of its kind in western europe and containing an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral germanic groups and romans bc ad edit main articles celts germanic peoples and romans in the netherlands germanic dialects around ad diachronic distribution of celtic peoples showing expansion into the southern low countries deteriorating climate in scandinavia around bc and later faster around bc might have triggered migration of the germanic tribes by the time this migration was complete around bc a few general cultural and linguistic groupings had emerged the north sea germanic or ingvaeones inhabited the northern part of the low countries they would later develop into the frisii and the early saxons a second grouping the weserrhine germanic or istvaeones extended along the middle rhine and weser and inhabited the low countries south of the great rivers this group consisted of tribes that would eventually develop into the salian franks also the celtic la tene culture c bc up to the roman conquest had expanded over a wide range including into the southern area of the low countries some scholars have speculated that even a third ethnic identity and language neither germanic nor celtic survived in the netherlands until the roman period the iron age nordwestblock culture that eventually was being absorbed by the celts to the south and the germanic peoples from the east rhine frontier of around ad during the gallic wars the area south of the oude rijn and west of the rhine was conquered by roman forces under julius caesar from bc to bc caesar describes two main tribes living in what is now the southern netherlands the menapii and the eburones the rhine became fixed around ad as romes northern frontier notable towns would arise along the limes germanicus nijmegen and voorburg at first part of gallia belgica the area south of the limes became part of the roman province of germania inferior the area to the north of the rhine inhabited by the frisii remained outside roman rule but not its presence and control while the border tribes batavi and cananefates served in the roman cavalry the batavi rose against the romans in the batavian rebellion of ad but were eventually defeated the batavi later merged with other tribes into the confederation of the salian franks whose identity emerged at the first half of the third century salian franks appear in roman texts as both allies and enemies the salian franks were forced by the confederation of the saxons from the east to move over the rhine into roman territory in the fourth century from their new base in west flanders and southwest netherlands they were raiding the english channel roman forces pacified the region but did not expel the franks who continued to be feared at least until the time of julian the apostate when salian franks were allowed to settle as foederati in toxandria after deteriorating climate conditions and the romans withdrew the frisii disappeared from the northern netherlands probably forced to resettle within roman territory as laeti in c coastal lands remained largely unpopulated for the next two centuries early middle ages edit main articles frankish kingdom and frisian kingdom this section may require cleanup to meet wikipedias quality standards the specific problem is tone is conversational rather than encyclopdic july franks frisians and saxons c ad after roman government in the area collapsed the franks expanded their territories in numerous kingdoms by the s clovis i had conquered and united all these territories in the southern netherlands in one frankish kingdom and from there continued his conquests into gaul during this expansion franks migrating to the south eventually adopted the vulgar latin of the local population a widening cultural divide grew with the franks remaining in their original homeland in the north ie southern netherlands and flanders who kept on speaking old frankish which by the ninth century had evolved into old low franconian or old dutch a dutchfrench language boundary came into existence frankish expansion to ad to the north of the franks climatic conditions on the coast improved so the abandoned land of the ancient frisii was during the migration period resettled again mostly by saxons but also by angles jutes and ancient frisii many moved on to england and came to be known as anglosaxons but those who stayed would be referred to as frisians named after the ancient inhabitants of the frisii frisian was spoken along the entire southern north sea coast and it is still the closest to english related living language after scots by the seventhcentury a frisian kingdom under king aldegisel and king redbad emerged with utrecht as its centre of power while dorestad was a frisian flourishing trading place between and around the city was often fought over between the frisians and the franks in at the battle of the boarn the frisians in the netherlands were after a series of wars defeated by the franks with the approval of the franks anglosaxon missionaries converted the frisian people to christianity willibrord established the archdiocese of utrecht and became bishop of the frisians however his successor boniface was murdered by

comprising territories from frisia in the north to the kingdom of italy in the south was the subject of numerous annexation attempts by its neighbors when the middle kingdom was partitioned the lands north of the alps passed to lothair ii and consecutively were named lotharingia after he died in lotharingia was partitioned into upper and lower lotharingia the latter part comprising the low countries that technically became part of east francia in although it was effectively under the control of vikings who raided the largely defenceless frisian and frankish towns lying on the frisian coast and along the rivers around lothair i acknowledged the viking rorik of dorestad as ruler of most of frisia around another viking terrorised the frisian lands he became known as godfrid duke of frisia but he was assassinated in after which gerolf of holland assumed lordship in frisia and viking rule came to an end the viking raids made the sway of french and german lords in the area weak

brabant and the utrecht were in a state of almost continual war or paradoxically formed personal unions the language and culture of most of the people who lived in the county of holland were originally frisian as frankish settlement progressed from flanders and brabant the area quickly became old low franconian or old dutch the rest of frisia in the north now friesland and groningen continued to maintain its independence and had its own institutions collectively called the frisian freedom and resented the imposition of the feudal system around ad due to several agricultural developments the economy started to develop at a fast pace and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen towns grew around monasteries and castles and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas especially in flanders and later also brabant wealthy cities started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the sovereign in practice this meant that brugge and antwerp became quasiindependent republics in their own right and would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in europe around ad farmers

lies between latitudes and n and longitudes and e the netherlands is geographically a very low and flat country with about of its area and of its population located below sea level and only about of its land exceeding one metre above sea level the country is for the most part flat with the exception of foothills in the far southeast up to a height of no more than metres and some low hill ranges in the central parts most of the areas below sea level are manmade caused by peat extraction or achieved through land reclamation since the late th century large polder areas are preserved through elaborate drainage systems that include dikes canals and pumping stations nearly of the countrys land area is reclaimed from the sea and from lakes much of the country was originally formed by the estuaries of three large european rivers the rhine rijn the meuse maas and the scheldt schelde as well as their tributaries the southwestern part of the netherlands is to this day a river delta of these three rivers the rhinemeusescheldt delta the netherlands is divided into north and south parts by the rhine the waal its main tributary branch and the meuse in the past these rivers functioned as a natural barrier between fiefdoms and hence historically created a cultural divide as is evident in some phonetic traits that are recognisable on either side of what the dutch call their great rivers de grote rivieren another significant branch of the rhine the ijssel river discharges into lake ijssel the former zuiderzee southern sea just like the previous this river forms a linguistic

floods in the netherlands north sea flood of and storm tides of the north sea the christmas flood of was the result of a northwesterly storm in total approximately people drowned over the centuries the dutch coastline has changed considerably as a result of natural disasters and human intervention most notable in terms of land loss was the storm of which created the archipelago of zeeland in the southwest on december st lucias flood affected the netherlands and germany killing more than people in one of the most destructive floods in recorded history the st elizabeth flood of and the mismanagement in its aftermath destroyed a newly reclaimed polder replacing it with the squarekilometre sqmi biesbosch tidal floodplains in the southcentre the huge north sea flood of early february caused the collapse of several dikes in the southwest of the netherlands more than people drowned in the flood the dutch government subsequently instituted a largescale programme the delta works to protect the country against future flooding which was completed over a period of more than thirty years the impact of disasters was to an extent increased through human activity relatively highlying swampland was drained to be used as farmland the drainage caused the fertile peat to contract and ground levels to drop upon which groundwater levels were lowered to compensate for the drop in ground level causing the underlying peat to contract further additionally until the th century peat was mined dried and used for fuel further exacerbating the problem centuries of extensive and poorly controlled peat extraction lowered an already low land surface by several metres even in flooded areas peat extraction continued through turf dredging because of the flooding farming was difficult which encouraged foreign trade the result of which was that the dutch were involved in world affairs since the early thth century map illustrating areas of the netherlands below sea level to guard against floods a series of defences against the water were contrived in the first millennium ad villages and farmhouses were built on manmade hills called terps later these terps were connected by dikes in the th century local government agencies called waterschappen water boards or hoogheemraadschappen high home councils started to appear whose job it was to maintain the water level and to protect a region from floods these agencies continue to exist as the ground level dropped the dikes by necessity grew and merged into an integrated system by the th century windmills had come into use to pump water out of areas below sea level the windmills were later used to drain lakes creating the famous polders citation needed in the afsluitdijk closure dike was completed blocking the former zuiderzee southern sea from the north sea and thus creating the ijsselmeer ijssel lake it became part of the larger zuiderzee works in which four polders totalling square kilometres sqmi were reclaimed from the sea the netherlands is one of the countries that may suffer most from climate change not only is the rising sea a problem but erratic weather patterns may cause the rivers to overflow a polder at metres below sea level delta works edit main article delta works the delta works are located in the provinces of south holland and zeeland after the disaster the delta works were constructed a comprehensive set of civil works throughout the dutch coast the project started in and was largely completed in with the completion of the maeslantkering new projects have been periodically started since to renovate and renew the delta works a main goal of the delta project was to reduce the risk of flooding in south holland and zeeland to once per years compared to per years for the rest of the country this was achieved by raising kilometres mi of outer seadykes and kilometres mi of inner canal and river dikes and by closing off the sea estuaries of the zeeland province new risk assessments occasionally show problems requiring additional delta project dyke reinforcements the delta project is considered by the american society of civil engineers as one of the seven wonders of the modern world it is anticipated that global warming in the st century will result in a rise in sea level which despite popular belief will possibly not overwhelm the measures the netherlands has taken to control floods citation needed even more specifically the netherlands is the only country in the world actively preparing for a sea level rise a politically neutral delta commission has formulated an action plan to cope with a sea level rise of metres ft and a simultaneous land height decline of centimetres in the plan foresees in the reinforcement of the existing coastal defenses like dikes and dunes with metres ft of additional flood protection climate change will not only threaten the netherlands from the sea side but could also alter rain fall patterns and river runoff to protect the country from river flooding another program is already being executed the room for the river plan grants more flow space to rivers protects the major populated areas and allows for periodic flooding of indefensible lands the few residents that lived in these socalled overflow areas have been moved to higher ground with some of that ground having been raised above anticipated flood levels protecting the country against floods is one element of climate change the other is that the pressure of the sea water on ground water will increase citation needed as a result the fresh water table will be pushed more inland resulting in more brackish or saline groundwater in the coastal provinces due to this change some drinking water areas will be forced to apply desalination despite the apparent abundance of water it will also affect agriculture the greenhouses can continue their production by becoming more water efficient they are already disconnected from the groundwater thereby not becoming more saline though they will need to become more energy and water efficient the push of more brackish water into the mainland will also cause changes in flora and fauna citation needed climate edit the predominant wind direction in the netherlands is southwest which causes a moderate maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters and typically high

austria honours this document dated as the founding of the nation the german name for austria osterreich meant eastern realm or eastern empire in old high german and is cognate with the word ostarrichi which first appears in the ostarrichi document of this word is probably a translation of medieval latin marchia orientalis into a local bavarian dialect austria was a prefecture of bavaria created in the word austria is a latinisation of the german name and was first recorded in the th century at the time the danube basin of austria upper and lower austria was the easternmost extent of bavaria and in fact of all the germans as at the time the territory of the former east germany was populated by slavic sorbs and polabians friedrich heer a thcentury austrian historian stated in his book der kampf um die osterreichische identitat the struggle over austrian identity that the germanic form ostarrichi was not a translation of the latin word but both resulted from a much older term originating in the celtic languages of ancient austria more than years ago the major part of the actual country was called norig by the celtic population hallstatt culture according to heer no or nor meant east or easterns dubious discuss whereas rig is related to the modern german reich meaning realm dubious discuss accordingly norig would essentially mean the same as ostarrichi and osterreich thus austria dubious discuss the celtic name was eventually latinised to noricum after the romans conquered the area that encloses most of modern day austria in around bc noricum later became a roman province in the mid st century ad history edit main article history of austria venus of willendorf to bc museum of natural history vienna settled in ancient times the central european land that is now austria was occupied in preroman times by various celtic tribes the celtic kingdom of noricum was later claimed by the roman empire and made a province present day petronell carnuntum in eastern austria was an important army camp turned capital city in what became known as the upper pannonia province carnuntum was home for people for nearly years heidentor remains of the roman military city of carnuntum after the fall of the roman empire the area was invaded by bavarians slavs and avars charlemagne conquered the area in ad encouraged colonisation and introduced christianity as part of eastern francia the core areas that now encompass austria were bequeathed to the house of babenberg the area was known as the marchia orientalis and was given to leopold of babenberg in the first record showing the name austria is from where it is written as ostarrichi referring to the territory of the babenberg march in the privilegium minus elevated austria to the status of a duchy in the babenbergs also acquired the duchy of styria with the death of frederick ii in the line of the babenbergs was extinguished as a result ottokar ii of bohemia effectively assumed control of the duchies of austria styria and carinthia his reign came to an end with his defeat at durnkrut at the hands of rudolph i of germany in thereafter until world war i austrias history was largely that of its ruling dynasty the habsburgs middle ages edit in the th and th centuries the habsburgs began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the duchy of austria in duke albert v of austria was chosen as the successor to his fatherinlaw emperor sigismund although albert himself only reigned for a year henceforth every emperor of the holy roman empire was a habsburg with only one exception the battle of vienna in broke the advance of the ottoman empire into europe the habsburgs began also to accumulate lands far from the hereditary lands in archduke maximilian only son of emperor frederick iii married the heiress maria of burgundy thus acquiring most of the netherlands for the family his son philip the fair married joanna the mad the heiress of castile and aragon and thus acquired spain and its italian african and new world appendages for the habsburgs in following the battle of mohacs bohemia and the part of hungary not occupied by the ottomans came under austrian rule ottoman expansion into hungary led to frequent conflicts between the two empires particularly evident in the socalled long war of to the turks made incursions into styria nearly twenty times which some of them are cited as burning pillaging and taking thousands of slaves th and th centuries edit the congress of vienna met in the objective of the congress was to settle the many issues arising from the french revolutionary wars the napoleonic wars and the dissolution of the holy roman empire during the long reign of leopold i and following the successful defense of vienna in under the command of the king of poland john iii sobieski a series of campaigns resulted in bringing all of hungary to austrian control by the treaty of karlowitz in emperor charles vi relinquished many of the gains the empire made in the previous years largely due to his apprehensions at the imminent extinction of the house of habsburg charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for recognition of the pragmatic sanction that made his daughter maria theresa his heir with the rise of prussia the austrianprussian dualism began in germany austria participated together with prussia and russia in the first and the third of the three partitions of poland in and th century edit austria later became engaged in a war with revolutionary france at the beginning highly unsuccessfully with successive defeats at the hands of napoleon meaning the end of the old holy roman empire in two years earlier in the empire of austria was founded in austria was part of the allied forces that invaded france and brought to an end the napoleonic wars an ethnolinguistic map of austriahungary it emerged from the congress of vienna in as one of the continents four dominant powers and a recognised great power the same year the german confederation deutscher bund was founded under the presidency of austria because of unsolved social political and national conflicts the german lands were shaken by the revolution aiming to create a unified germany a unified germany would have been possible either as a greater germany or a greater austria or just the german confederation without austria at all as austria was not willing to relinquish its germanspeaking territories to what would become the german empire of the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the prussian king friedrich wilhelm iv in austria and prussia fought together against denmark and secured the independence from denmark of the duchies of schleswig and holstein but as they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered they fought the austroprussian war in defeated by prussia in the battle of koniggratz austria had to leave the german confederation and subsequently no longer took part in german politics the austrohungarian compromise of the ausgleich provided for a dual sovereignty the austrian empire and the kingdom of hungary under franz joseph i the austrianhungarian rule of this diverse empire included various slavic groups including croats czechs poles rusyns serbs slovaks slovenes and ukrainians as well as large italian and romanian communities as a result ruling austriahungary became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements requiring considerable reliance on an expanded secret police yet the government of austria tried its best to be accommodating in some respects the reichsgesetzblatt publishing the laws and ordinances of cisleithania was issued in eight languages and all national groups were entitled to schools in their own language and to the use of their mother tongue at state offices for example th century edit archduke franz ferdinand right with his family in austriahungary found an excuse in the promulgation of the second constitutional era in the ottoman empire to annex bosnia and herzegovina the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo in by bosnian serb gavrilo princip was used by leading austrian politicians and generals to persuade the emperor to declare war on serbia thereby risking and prompting the outbreak of world war i which eventually led to the dissolution of the austrohungarian empire over one million austrohungarian soldiers died in world war i postwar settlement edit on october the elected german members of the reichsrat parliament of imperial austria met in vienna as the provisional national assembly for german austria provisorische nationalversammlung fur deutschosterreich on october the assembly founded the state of german austria by appointing a government called staatsrat this new government was invited by the emperor to take part in the decision on the planned armistice with italy but refrained from this business citation needed this left the responsibility for the end of the war on november solely to the emperor and his government on november the emperor advised by ministers of the old and the new government declared he would not take part in state business any more on november german austria by law declared itself to be a democratic republic and part of the new german republic the constitution renaming the staatsrat as bundesregierung federal government and nationalversammlung as nationalrat national council was passed on november citation needed german speaking provinces claimed by austria in the border of the subsequent second republic of austria is outlined in red the treaty of saintgermain of for hungary the treaty of trianon of confirmed and consolidated the new order of central europe which to a great extent had been established in november creating new states and altering others over million germanspeaking austrians found themselves living outside the newborn austrian republic as minorities in the newly formed or enlarged states of czechoslovakia yugoslavia hungary and italy these included the provinces of south tyrol which became part of italy and german bohemia czechoslovakia the status of german bohemia sudetenland later played a role in sparking wwii the status of south tyrol was a lingering problem between austria and italy until it was officially settled by the s with a great degree of autonomy being granted to it by the italian national government between and austria was known as the state of german austria staat deutschosterreich not only did the entente powers forbid german austria to unite with germany they also rejected the name german austria in the peace treaty to be signed it was therefore changed to republic of austria in late the border between austria and the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes later yugoslavia was settled with the carinthian plebiscite in october and allocated the major part of the territory of the former austrohungarian crownland of carinthia to austria this set the border on the karawanken mountain range with many slovenes remaining in austria interwar period and world war ii edit main articles first austrian republic federal state of austria nazi germany and history of the jews in austria the holocaust in austria after the war inflation began to devalue the krone which was still austrias currency in autumn austria was granted an international loan supervised by the league of nations the purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy stabilise the currency and improve austrias general economic condition the loan meant that austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the league of nations in the schilling replacing the krone at a rate of was introduced later it was called the alpine dollar due to its stability from to the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing after black friday the first austrian republic lasted until when chancellor engelbert dollfuss using what he called selfswitchoff of parliament selbstausschaltung des parlaments established an autocratic regime tending toward italian fascism the two big parties at this time the social democrats and the conservatives had paramilitary armies the social democrats schutzbund was now declared illegal but still operative as civil war broke out in february several members of the schutzbund were executed the social democratic party was outlawed and many of its members were imprisoned or emigrated on may the austrofascists imposed a new constitution maiverfassung which cemented dollfusss power but on july he was assassinated in a nazi coup attempt hitler speaking at heldenplatz vienna his successor kurt schuschnigg struggled to keep austria independent as the better german state but on march austrian nazis took over government while german troops occupied the country on march the anschluss of austria was officially declared two days later hitler an austrian by birth announced what he called the reunification of his home country with the rest of germany on viennas heldenplatz he established a plebiscite confirming the union with germany in april parliamentary elections were held in germany including recently annexed austria on april they were the final elections to the reichstag during nazi rule and took the form of a singlequestion referendum asking whether voters approved of a single naziparty list for the member reichstag as well as the recent annexation of austria the anschluss turnout in the election was officially with voting yes in the case of austria hitlers native soil of an electorate of officially went to the ballots with a positive tally of the liberation of mauthausen concentration camp austria was incorporated into the third reich and ceased to exist as an independent country the aryanisation of the wealth of jewish austrians started immediately in midmarch with a socalled wild ie extralegal phase but soon was structured legally and bureaucratically to strip jewish citizens of any assets they possessed the nazis called austria ostmark until when it was again renamed and called alpendonaureichsgaue some of the most prominent nazis were native austrians including hitler adolf eichmann ernst kaltenbrunner arthur seyssinquart franz stangl and odilo globocnik as were of the staff at nazi extermination camps vienna fell on april during the soviet vienna offensive just before the total collapse of the third reich the invading allied powers in particular the americans planned for the supposed alpine fortress operation of a national redoubt that was largely to have taken place on austrian soil in the mountains of the eastern alps however it never materialized because of the rapid collapse of the reich karl renner and adolf scharf socialist party of austria social democrats and revolutionary socialists leopold kunschak austrias peoples party former christian social peoples party and johann koplenig communist party of austria declared austrias secession from the third reich by the declaration of independence on april and set up a provisional government in vienna under state chancellor renner the

alone a fact officially recognised by chancellor franz vranitzky in after world war ii edit much like germany austria was divided into british french soviet and american zones and governed by the allied commission for austria as forecast in the moscow declaration in there was a subtle difference in the treatment of austria by the allies the austrian government consisting of social democrats conservatives and communists until and residing in vienna which was surrounded by the soviet zone was recognised by the western allies in october after some doubts that renner could be stalins puppet thus the creation of a separate western austrian government and the division of the country was avoidable austria in general was treated as though it had been originally invaded by germany and liberated by the allies on may after talks which lasted for years and were influenced by the cold war austria regained full independence by concluding the austrian state treaty with the four occupying powers on october after all occupation troops had left austria declared its permanent neutrality by an act of parliament austria joined the european union in and signed the lisbon treaty in the political system of the second republic is based on the constitution of and which was reintroduced in the system came to be characterised by proporz meaning that most posts of political importance were split evenly between members of the social democrats and the peoples party interest group chambers with mandatory membership eg for workers business people farmers grew to considerable importance and were usually consulted in the legislative process so that hardly any legislation was passed that did not reflect widespread consensus since governing via a singleparty government has occurred between conservatives and social democrats during all other legislative periods either a grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats or a small coalition one of these two and a smaller party ruled the country following a referendum in at which consent reached a majority of twothirds the country became a member of the european union on january the major parties spo and ovp have contrary

contents influences christian latin vulgar latin changes in vocabulary syntax and grammar syntax orthography medieval latin literature important medieval latin authors thth centuries thth centuries th century th century th century th century th century th century literary movements works notes references external links influences edit christian latin edit medieval latin had an enlarged vocabulary which freely borrowed from other sources it was heavily influenced by the language of the vulgate which contained many peculiarities alien to classical latin that resulted from a more or less direct translation from greek and hebrew these peculiarities mirrored the original not only in its vocabulary but also in its grammar and syntax greek provided much of the technical vocabulary of christianity the various germanic languages spoken by the germanic tribes who invaded southern europe were also major sources of new words germanic leaders became the rulers of parts of the roman empire they conquered and words from their languages were freely imported into the vocabulary of law other more ordinary words were replaced by coinages from vulgar latin or germanic sources because the classical words had fallen into disuse an illuminated manuscript of a book of hours contains prayers in medieval latin latin was also spread to areas such as ireland and germany where romance languages were not spoken and which had never known roman rule works written in these lands where latin was a learned language with no relation to the local vernacular also influenced the vocabulary and syntax of medieval latin since abstract subjects like science and philosophy were communicated in latin the latin vocabulary developed for them is the source of a great many technical words in modern languages english words like abstract subject communicate matter probable and their cognates in other european languages generally have the meanings given to them in medieval latin vulgar latin edit the influence of vulgar latin was also apparent in the syntax of some medieval latin writers although classical latin continued to be held in high esteem and studied as models for literary compositions the high point of the development of medieval latin as a literary language came with the carolingian renaissance a rebirth of learning kindled under the patronage of charlemagne king of the franks alcuin was charlemagnes latin secretary and an important writer in his own right his influence led to a rebirth of latin literature and learning after the depressed period following the final disintegration of the authority of the western roman empire although it was simultaneously developing into the romance languages latin itself remained very conservative as it was no longer a native language and there were many ancient and medieval grammar books to give one standard form on the other hand strictly speaking there was no single form of medieval latin every latin author in the medieval period spoke latin as a second language with varying degrees of fluency and syntax grammar and vocabulary were often influenced by an authors native language this was especially true beginning around the th century after which the language became increasingly adulterated late medieval latin documents written by french speakers tend to show similarities to medieval french grammar and vocabulary those written by germans tend to show similarities to german etc for instance rather than following the classical latin practice of generally placing the verb at the end medieval writers would often follow the conventions of their own native language instead whereas latin had no definite or indefinite articles medieval writers sometimes used forms of unus as an indefinite article and forms of ille reflecting usage in the romance languages as a definite article or even quidam meaning a certain onething in classical latin as something like an article unlike classical latin where esse to be was the only auxiliary verb medieval latin writers might use habere to have as an auxiliary similar to constructions in germanic and romance languages the accusative and infinitive construction in classical latin was often replaced by a subordinate clause introduced by quod or quia this is almost identical for example to the use of que in similar constructions in french in every age from the late th century onwards there were learned writers especially within the church who were familiar enough with classical syntax to be aware that these forms and usages were wrong and resisted their use thus the latin of a theologian like st thomas aquinas or of an erudite clerical historian such as william of tyre tends to avoid most of the characteristics described above showing its period in vocabulary and spelling alone the features listed are much more prominent in the language of lawyers eg the th century english domesday book physicians technical writers and secular chroniclers however the use of quod to introduce subordinate clauses was especially pervasive and is found at all levels changes in vocabulary syntax and grammar edit medieval latin had ceased to be a living language and was instead a scholarly language of the minority of educated men in medieval europe used in official documents more than for everyday communication this resulted in two major features of medieval latin compared with classical latin first many authors attempted to show off their knowledge of classical latin by using rare or archaic constructions sometimes anachronistically ie haphazardly mixing constructions from republican and imperial latin which in reality existed centuries apart second many lesser scholars had a limited grasp of proper latin or were increasingly influenced by vulgar latin which was mutating into the romance languages word order usually tended towards that of the vernacular language of the author and not the artificial and polished word order of classical latin conversely an erudite scholar might attempt to show off by intentionally constructing a very complicated sentence because latin is an inflected language it is technically possible to place related words at opposite ends of a paragraphlong sentence and owing to the complexity of achieving this it was seen by some as a sign of great skill typically prepositions are used much more frequently as in modern romance languages for greater clarity instead of using the ablative case alone for example while amico and cum amico both mean with a friend in classical and medieval latin for the sake of clarity medieval latin would tend to include the preposition cum further in classical latin the subject of a verb was often left implied unless it was being stressed videt he sees for clarity medieval latin more frequently includes an explicit subject is videt he sees without necessarily stressing the subject various changes occurred in vocabulary and certain words were mixed into different declensions or conjugations many new compound verbs were formed some words retained their original structure but drastically changed in meaning eg animositas specifically means wrath in medieval latin while in classical latin it generally referred to high spirits excited spirits of any kind owing to heavy use of biblical terms there was a large influx of new words borrowed from greek and hebrew and even some grammatical influences this obviously largely occurred among priests and scholars not the laity in general it is difficult to express abstract concepts in latin and many scholars admitted as much for example platos abstract concept of the truth could only be expressed in latin as literally that which is always true medieval scholars and theologians translating both the bible and greek philosophers into latin out of the koine and classical greek cobbled together many new abstract concept words in latin syntax edit indirect discourse which in classical latin was achieved by using a subject accusative and infinitive was now often simply replaced by new conjunctions serving the function of english that such as quod quia or quoniam there was a high level of overlap between the old and new constructions even within the same authors work and it was often a matter of preference a particularly famous and often cited example is from the venerable bede using both constructions within the same sentence dico me scire et quod sum ignobilis i say that i know accusative and infinitive and that i am unknown new construction the resulting subordinate clause often used the subjunctive mood instead of the indicative this new syntax for indirect discourse is among the most prominent features of medieval latin and the largest syntactical change several substitutions were often used instead of subjunctive clause constructions these did not break the rules of classical latin outright but were an alternate way to express the same meaning avoiding the use of a subjunctive clause the present participle was frequently used adverbially in place of qui or cum clauses such as clauses of time cause concession and purpose this was loosely similar to the use of the present participle in an ablative absolute phrase but the participle did not need to be in the ablative case habeo i have to and debeo i must would be used to express obligation more often than the gerundive given that obligation inherently carries a sense of futurity carthage must be destroyed at some point in the future this anticipates how the romance languages such as french would use habeo as the basis for their future tenses abandoning the latin forms of future tense while in latin amare habeo is the indirect discourse i have to love in the french equivalent aimerai habeo gt ayyo gt ai aimerai this has become the future tense i will love losing the sense of obligation in medieval latin however this was still indirect discourse and was not yet used as simply a future tense instead of a clause introduced by ut or ne an infinitive was often used with a verb of hoping fearing promising etc conversely some authors might haphazardly switch between the subjunctive and indicative forms of verbs with no intended difference in meaning the usage of sum changed significantly it was frequently omitted or implied further many medieval authors did not feel that it made sense for the perfect passive construction laudatus sum to use the present tense of esse in a past tense construction so they began using fui the past perfect of sum interchangeably with sum chaos in the usage of demonstrative pronouns hic ille iste and even the intensive ipse are often used virtually interchangeably in anticipation of romance languages hic and ille were also frequently used simply to express the definite article the which classical latin did not possess unus was also used for the indirect article a an use of reflexives became much more loose a reflexive pronoun in a subordinate clause might refer to the subject of the main clause the reflexive possessive suus might be used in place of a possessive genitive such as eius comparison of adjectives changed somewhat the comparative form was sometimes used with positive or superlative meaning also the adverb magis was often used with a positive adjective to indicate a comparative meaning and multum and nimis could be used with a positive form of adjective to give a superlative meaning classical latin used the ablative absolute but as stated above in medieval latin examples of nominative absolute or accusative absolute may be found this was a point of difference between the ecclesiastical latin of the clergy and the vulgar latin of the laity which existed alongside it the educated clergy mostly knew that traditional latin did not use the nominative or accusative case in such constructions but only the ablative case these constructions are observed in the medieval era but they are changes that developed among the uneducated commoners classical latin does not distinguish progressive action in the present tense thus laudo can mean either i praise or i am praising in imitation of greek medieval latin could use a present participle with sum to form a periphrastic tense equivalent to the english progressive this greek periphrastic tense formation could also be done in the past and future tenses laudans sum i am praising laudans eram i was praising laudans ero i will be praising classical latin verbs had at most two voices active and passive but greek the original language of the new testament had an additional middle voice or reflexive voice which was used inter alia to express when the subject is acting upon itself for example achilles put the armor onto himself or jesus clothed himself in the robe would use the middle voice because latin had no middle voice medieval latin expresses such sentences by putting the verb in the passive voice form but the conceptual meaning is active similar to latin deponent verbs for example the medieval latin translation of genesis states literally that god was moved over the waters spiritus dei ferebatur super aquas genesis but it is just expressing a greek middlevoice verb god moved himself over the waters overlapping with orthography differences see below certain diphthongs were sometimes shortened oe to e and ae to e thus oecumenicus becomes the more familiar ecumenicus more familiar as this later form because religious terms such as ecumenical were more common in medieval latin the oe diphthong is not particularly frequent in latin but the shift from ae to e affects many common words such as caelum heaven being shortened to celum or even puellae girls being shortened to puelle orthography edit the prufening dedicatory inscription of composed in medieval latin many striking differences between classical and medieval latin are found in orthography perhaps the most striking difference is that medieval manuscripts used a wide range of abbreviations by means of superscripts special characters etc for instance the letters n and s were often omitted and replaced by a diacritical mark above the preceding or following letter apart from this some of the most frequently occurring differences are as follows clearly many of these would have been influenced by the spelling and indeed pronunciation of the vernacular language and thus varied between different european countries following the carolingian reforms of the th century carolingian minuscule was widely adopted leading to a clear differentiation between capital and lowercase letters a partial or full differentiation between v and u and between j and i the diphthong ae is usually collapsed and simply written as e or e caudata e for example puellae might be written puelle or puelle the same happens with the diphthong oe for example in pena edipus from poena oedipus this feature is already found on coin inscriptions of the th century eg reipublice for reipublicae conversely an original e in classical latin was often represented by ae or oe eg aecclesia and coena also reflected in english spellings such as foetus because of a severe decline in the knowledge of greek in loanwords and foreign names from or transmitted through greek y and i might be used more or less interchangeably ysidorus egiptus from isidorus aegyptus this is also found in pure latin words ocius more swiftly appears as ocyus and silva as sylva this last being a form which survived into the th century and so became embedded in modern botanical latin also cf pennsylvania h might be lost so that habere becomes abere or mihi becomes mi the latter also occurred in classical latin or mihi may be written michi indicating that the h had come to be pronounced as k or perhaps kh this pronunciation is not found in classical latin the loss of h in pronunciation also led to the addition of h in writing where it did not previously belong especially in the vicinity of r such as chorona for corona a tendency also sometimes seen in classical latin ti before a vowel is often written as ci tsi so that divitiae becomes diviciae or divicie tertius becomes tercius vitium vicium the combination mn might have another plosive inserted so that alumnus becomes alumpnus somnus sompnus single consonants were often doubled or vice versa so that tranquillitas becomes tranquilitas and africa becomes affrica syncopation became more frequent vi especially in verbs in the perfect tense might be lost so that novisse becomes nosse this occurred in classical latin as well but was much more frequent in medieval latin these orthographical differences were often due to changes in pronunciation or as in the previous example morphology which authors reflected in their writing by the th century erasmus complained that speakers from different countries were unable to understand each others form of latin the gradual changes in latin did not escape the notice of contemporaries petrarch writing in the th century complained about this linguistic decline which helped fuel his general dissatisfaction with his own era medieval latin literature edit the corpus of medieval latin literature encompasses a wide range of texts including such diverse works as sermons hymns hagiographical texts travel literature histories epics and lyric poetry the first half of the th century saw the literary activities of the great christian authors jerome c and augustine of hippo whose texts had an enormous influence on theological thought of the middle ages and of the latters disciple prosper of aquitaine c of the later th century and early th century sidonius apollinaris c after and ennodius both from gaul are well known for their poems as is venantius fortunatus c this was also a period of transmission the roman patrician boethius c translated part of aristotle s logical corpus thus preserving it for the latin west and wrote the influential literary and philosophical treatise de consolatione philosophiae cassiodorus c founded an important library at the monastery of vivarium near squillace where many texts from antiquity were to be preserved isidore of seville c collected all scientific knowledge still available in his time into what might be called the first encyclopedia the etymologiae gregory of tours c wrote a lengthy history of the frankish kings gregory came from a galloroman aristocratic family and his latin which shows many aberrations from the classical forms testifies to the declining significance of classical education in gaul at the same time good knowledge of latin and even of greek was being preserved in monastic culture in ireland and was brought to england and the european mainland by missionaries in the course of the th and th centuries such as columbanus who founded the monastery of bobbio in northern italy ireland was also the birthplace of a strange poetic style known as hisperic latin other important insular authors include the historian gildas c and the poet aldhelm c benedict biscop c founded the monastery of wearmouthjarrow and furnished it with books which he had taken home from a journey to rome and which were later used by bede c to write his ecclesiastical history of the english people many medieval latin works have been published in the series patrologia

external links key records management terminology edit records identification is the means by which consensus is achieved within an organization that leads to how a record is uniquely distinguished from other nonrecord material such as a convenience file or draft how records are managed throughout their life cycle is formalized into the policies and practices of the rim program once a record is created record controls are triggered to regulate its access and distribution a human resource employee may separate documents from a personnel file and keep them in a locked cabinet with a control log to control and track access role security may be set on a repository allowing access to approved users software may identify the official record versions copies and distribution just as the records of the organization come in a variety of formats the storage of records can vary throughout the organization file maintenance may be carried out by the owner designee a records repository or clerk records may be managed in a centralized location such as a records center or repository or the control of records may be decentralized across various departments and locations within the entity records may be formally and discretely identified by coding and housed in folders specifically designed for optimum protection and storage capacity or they may be casually identified and filed with no apparent indexing organizations that manage records casually find it difficult to access and retrieve information when needed the inefficiency of filing maintenance and storage systems can prove to be costly in terms of wasted space and resources expended searching for records an inactive record is a record that is no longer needed to conduct current business but is being preserved until it meets the end of its retention period such as when a project ends a product line is retired or the end of a fiscal reporting period is reached these records may hold business legal fiscal or historical value for the entity in the future and therefore are required to be maintained for a short or permanent duration records are managed according to the retention schedule once the life of a record has been satisfied according to its predetermined period and there are no legal holds pending it is authorized for final disposition which may include destruction transfer or permanent preservation a disaster recovery plan is a written and approved course of action to take after a disaster strikes that details how an organization will restore critical business functions and reclaim damaged or threatened records an active record is a record needed to perform current operations subject to frequent use and usually located near the user in the past records management was sometimes used to refer only to the management of records which were no longer in everyday use but still needed to be kept semicurrent or inactive records often stored in basements or offsite more modern usage tends to refer to the entire lifecycle of records from the point of creation right through until their eventual disposal the iso standard iso defines records management as the field of management responsible for the efficient and systematic control of the creation receipt maintenance use and disposition of records including the processes for capturing and maintaining evidence of and information about business activities and transactions in the form of records the iso defines records as information created received and maintained as evidence and information by an organization or person in pursuance of legal obligations or in the transaction of business while there are many purposes of and benefits to records management as both these definitions highlight a key feature of records is their ability to serve as evidence of an event proper records management can help preserve this feature of records it should be noted that the format and media of records is generally irrelevant for the purposes of records management from the perspective that records must be identified and managed regardless of their form the iso considers management of both physical and electronic records also section dl of the united states department of defense standard dod std defines records management as the planning controlling directing organizing training promoting and other managerial activities involving the life cycle of information including creation maintenance use storage retrieval and disposal regardless of media practicing records management edit a records manager is someone who is responsible for records management in an organization section of the iso states that records management includes setting policies and standards assigning responsibilities and authorities establishing and promulgating procedures and guidelines providing a range of services relating to the management and use of records designing implementing and administering specialized systems for managing records and integrating records management into business systems and processes thus the practice of records management may involve planning the information needs of an organization identifying information requiring capture creating approving and enforcing policies and practices regarding records including their organization and disposal developing a records storage plan which includes the short and longterm housing of physical records and digital information identifying classifying and storing records coordinating access to records internally and outside of the organization balancing the requirements of business confidentiality data privacy and public access executing a retention policy on the disposal of records which are no longer required for operational reasons according to organizational policies statutory requirements and other regulations this may involve either their destruction or permanent preservation in an archive records management principles and automated records management systems aid in the capture classification and ongoing management of records throughout their lifecycle such a system may be paper based such as index cards as used in a library or may be a computer system such as an electronic records management application defensible solutions edit a defensible solution is one that can be supported with clearly documented policies processes and procedures that drive how and why work is performed as well as one that has clearly documented proof of behavior patterns proving that an organization follows such documented constraints to the best of their ability while defensibility applies to all aspects of records life cycle it is considered most important in the context of records destruction where it is known as defensible disposition or defensible destruction and helps an organization explicitly justify and prove things like who destroys records why they destroy them how they destroy them when they destroy them and where they destroy them records life cycle edit the records life cycle or records lifecycle consists of discrete phases covering the life span of a record from its creation to its final disposition in the creation phase records growth is expounded by modern electronic systems records will continue to be created and captured by the organization at an explosive rate as it conducts the business of the organization correspondence regarding a product failure is written for internal leadership financial statements and reports are generated for public and regulatory scrutiny the old corporate logo is retired and a new one including color scheme and approved corporate font takes its place in the organizations history examples of records phases include those for creation of a record modification of a record movement of a record through its different states while in existence and destruction of a record throughout the records life cycle issues such as security privacy disaster recovery emerging technologies and mergers are addressed by the rim professional responsible for organizational rim programs rim professionals are instrumental in controlling and safeguarding the information assets of the entity they understand how to manage the creation access distribution storage and disposition of records and information in an efficient and costeffective manner using rim methodology principles and best practices in compliance with records and information laws and regulations records classification edit records managers use classification or categorization of record types as a means of working with records such classifications assist in functions such as creation organization storage retrieval movement and destruction of records at the highest level of classification are physical versus electronic records physical records are those records such as paper that can be touched and which take up physical space electronic records also often referred to as digital records are those records that are generated with and used by information technology devices classification of records is achieved through the design maintenance and application of taxonomies which allow records managers to perform functions such as the categorization tagging segmenting or grouping of records according to various traits enterprise records edit enterprise records represent those records that are common to most enterprises regardless of their function purpose or sector such records often revolve around the daytoday operations of an enterprise and cover areas such as but not limited litigation employee management consultant or contractor management customer engagements purchases sales and contracts the types of enterprises that generate and work with such records include but are not limited to forprofit companies nonprofit companies and government agencies industry records edit industry records represent those records that are common and apply only to a specific industry or set of industries examples include but are not limited to medical industry specific records eg hipaa pharmaceutical industry specific records and food industry specific records legal hold records edit legal hold records are those records that are mandated usually by legal counsel or compliance personnel to be held for a period of time either by a government or by an enterprise and for the purposes of addressing potential issues associated with compliance audits and litigation such records are assigned legal hold traits that are in addition to classifications which are as a result of enterprise or industry classifications legal hold data traits may include but are not limited to things such as legal hold flags eg legal hold true or false the organization driving the legal hold descriptions of why records must be legally held what period of time records must be held for and the hold location managing physical records edit managing physical records involves different disciplines or capabilities and may draw on a variety of forms of expertise identifying records if an item is presented as a legal record it needs to be authenticated forensic experts may need to examine a document or artifact to determine that it is not a forgery and that any damage alteration or missing content is documented in extreme cases items may be subjected to a microscope xray radiocarbon dating or chemical analysis this level of authentication is rare but requires that special care be taken in the creation and retention of the records of an organization storing records records must be stored in such a way that they are accessible and safeguarded against environmental damage a typical paper document may be stored in a filing cabinet in an office however some organisations employ file rooms with specialized environmental controls including temperature and humidity vital records may need to be stored in a disasterresistant safe or vault to protect against fire flood earthquakes and conflict in extreme cases the item may require both disaster proofing and public access such as the original signed us constitution civil engineers may need to be consulted to determine that the file room can effectively withstand the weight of shelves and file cabinets filled with paper historically some military vessels were designed to take into account the weight of their operating procedures on paper as part of their ballast equation citation needed modern recordkeeping technologies have transferred much of that information to electronic storage in addition to onsite storage of records many organizations operate their own offsite records centers or contract with commercial records centres retrieval of records in addition to being able to store records enterprises must also establish the proper capabilities for retrieval of records in the event they are needed for a purpose such as an audit or litigation or for the case of destruction record retrieval capabilities become complex when dealing with electronic records especially when they have not been adequately tagged or classified for discovery circulating records tracking the record while it is away from the normal storage area is referred to as circulation often this is handled by simple written recording procedures however many modern records environments use a computerized system involving bar code scanners or radiofrequency identification technology rfid to track movement of the records these can also be used for periodic auditing to identify unauthorized movement of the record disposal of records disposal of records does not always mean destruction it can also include transfer to a historical archive museum or private individual destruction of records ought to be authorized by law statute regulation or operating procedure and the records should be disposed of with care to avoid inadvertent disclosure of information the process needs to be welldocumented starting with a records retention schedule and policies and procedures that have been approved at the highest level an inventory of the records disposed of should be maintained including certification that they have been destroyed records should never simply be discarded as refuse most organizations use processes including pulverization paper shredding or incineration commercially available products can manage records through all processes active inactive archival retention scheduling and disposal some also utilize rfid technology for the tracking of the physical file managing electronic records edit the general principles of records management apply to records in any format digital records almost always referred to as electronic records however raise specific issues it is more difficult to ensure that the content context and structure of records is preserved and protected when the records do not have a physical existence this has important implications for the authenticity reliability and trustworthiness of records much research is being conducted on the management of electronic records the international research on permanent authentic records in electronic systems interpares project is one example of such an initiative based at the school of library archival and information studies at the university of british columbia in vancouver british columbia canada the interpares project is a collaborative project between researchers all across the world committed to developing theories and methodologies to ensure the reliability accuracy and authenticity of electronic records functional requirements for computer systems to manage electronic records have been produced by the us department of defense the the united kingdoms national archives also known as the national archives of england amp wales and the european commission whose moreq model requirements for the management of electronic records specification has been translated into at least twelve languages funded by the european commission particular concerns exist about the ability to access and read electronic records over time since the rapid pace of change in technology can make the software used to create the records obsolete leaving the records unreadable a considerable amount of research is being undertaken to address this under the heading of digital preservation the public record office victoria prov located in melbourne australia published the victorian electronic records strategy vers which includes a standard for the preservation longterm storage and access to permanent electronic records the vers standard has been adopted by all victorian government departments a digital archive has been established by prov to enable the general public to access permanent records archives new zealand is also setting up a digital archive electronic tax records electronic tax records are computerbasednonpaper versions of records required by tax agencies like the internal revenue service there is substantial confusion about what constitutes acceptable digital records for the irs as the concept is relatively new the subject is discussed in publication and bulletin but not in specific detail businesses and individuals wishing to convert their paper records into scanned copies may be at risk if they do so for example it is unclear if an irs auditor would accept a jpeg png or pdf format scanned copy of a purchase receipt for a deducted expense item current issues in records management edit government compliance and legal issues as of records management has increased interest among corporations due to new compliance regulations and statutes while government legal and healthcare entities have a strong historical records management discipline general recordkeeping of corporate records has been poorly standardized and implemented in addition scandals such as the enron andersen scandal and more recently recordsrelated mishaps at morgan stanley have renewed interest in corporate records compliance retention period requirements litigation preparedness and related issues statutes such as the us sarbanesoxley act have created new concerns among corporate compliance officers that result in more standardization of records management practices within an organization most of the s has seen discussions between records managers and it managers and the emphasis has expanded to include the legal aspects as it is now focused on compliance and risk security privacy data protection and identity theft have become issues of interest for records managers the role of the records manager to aid in the protection of an organizations records has often grown to include attention to these concerns the need to ensure that certain information about individuals is not retained has brought greater focus to records retention schedules and records destruction adoption and implementation the most significant issue is implementing the required changes to individual and corporate culture to derive the benefits to internal and external stakeholders records management is often seen as an unnecessary or low priority administrative task that can be performed at the lowest levels within an organization publicised events have demonstrated that records management is in fact the responsibility of all individuals within an organization and the corporate entity an issue that has been very controversial among records managers has been the uncritical adoption of electronic document and records management systems edrms one well known rm thinker steve bailey has stated as far as the average user is concerned the edrms is something they didnt want dont like and cant use as such its no wonder that so few users accept them as one person once said to me making me use an edrms is like asking a plasterer to use a hammer and now finally it is time to turn our eyes to the records management profession itself in my opinion we have come within a whisker of allowing our blind obsession with edrms to turn us into an intellectuallysterile vendorled profession for the best part of a decade we have allowed others to do the thinking for us and have come to rely on edrms as our intellectualcrutch but make no mistake about it the blame for this rests squarely with us like children following the pied piper we allowed ourselves to be so enchanted by the tune being played that we were led without question or debate wherever the technology took us rms debate the case against edrms has edrms been a success the case for the prosecution rms conference edinburgh april impact of internet and social media another issue of great interest to records managers is the impact of the internet and related social media such as wikis blogs forums and companies such as facebook and twitter on traditional records management practices principles and concepts since many of these tools allow rapid creation and dissemination of records and often even in anonymous form records life cycle management a difficult challenge for many enterprises is tied to the tracking of records through their entire information life cycle so that its clear at all times where a record exists or if it still exists at all the tracking of records through their life cycles allows records management staff to understand when and how to apply records related rules such as rules for legal hold or destruction conversion of paper records to electronic form as the world becomes more digital in nature an ever growing issue for the records management community is the conversion of existing or incoming paper records to electronic form such conversions are most often performed with the intent to save storage costs storage space and in hopes of reducing records retrieval time tools such as document scanners optical character recognition software and electronic document management systems are used to facilitate such conversions education and certification edit many colleges and universities offer degree programs in library and information sciences which cover records management furthermore there are professional organizations such as the records and information management professionals australasia rimpa and the institute of certified records managers which provides a separate nondegreed professional certification for practitioners the certified records manager

electronic records management systems edit an electronic document and records management system edrm is a computer program or set of programs used to track and store records the term is distinguished from imaging and document management systems that specialize in paper capture and document management respectively erm systems commonly provide specialized security and auditing functionality tailored to the needs of records managers the national archives and records administration nara has endorsed the us department of defense standard as an adequate and appropriate basis for addressing the basic challenges of managing records in the automated environment that increasingly characterizes the creation and use of records records management vendors can be certified as compliant with the dod std after verification from the joint interoperability test command which builds test case procedures writes detailed and summary final reports on certified products and performs onsite inspection of software the national archives in the uk has published two sets of functional requirements to promote the development of the electronic records management software market and it ran a program to evaluate products against the requirements while these requirements were initially formulated in collaboration with central government they have been taken up with enthusiasm by many parts of the wider public sector in the uk and in other parts of the world the testing program has now closed the national archives is no longer accepting applications for testing the national archives requirements remain current the european commission has published moreq the model requirements for electronic records and document management in although not a formal standard it is widely regarded and referred to as a standard this was funded by the commissions ida program and was developed at the instigation of the dlm forum a major update of moreq known as moreq was published in february this

contents terminology usage vice chairman and deputy chairman public corporations see also references external links terminology edit other terms sometimes used for the office and its holder include chair chairperson chairwoman presiding officer president moderator facilitator and convenor the chairman of a parliamentary chamber is often called the speaker the term chair is sometimes used in lieu of chairman in response to criticisms that using chairman is sexist it is commonly used today and has been used as a substitute for chairman since the middle of the th century with its earliest citation in the oxford english dictionary dated only four years after the first citation for chairman usage edit in his state of the union address thenus president george h w bush used chairman for men and chair for women a canadian study found the toronto star newspaper referring to most presiding men as chairman and to most presiding women as chairperson or as chairwoman the chronicle of higher education uses chairman for men and chairperson for women an analysis of the british national corpus found chairman used times chairperson times and chairwoman times the national association of parliamentarians does not approve using chairperson the wall street journal the new york times and united press international all use chairwoman or chairman when referring to women and forbid use of chair or of chairperson except in direct quotations in world schools style debating male chairs are called mr chairman and female chairs are called madame chair the franklincovey style guide for business and technical communication as well as the american psychological association style guide advocate using chair or chairperson rather than chairman the oxford dictionary of american usage and style suggests that the genderneutral forms are gaining ground it advocates using chair to refer both to men and to women in the united states the presiding officer of the lower house of a legislative body such as the house of representatives is frequently titled the speaker while the upper house such as the senate is commonly chaired by a president the word chair can refer to the place from which the holder of the office presides whether on a chair at a lectern or elsewhere during meetings the person presiding is said to be in the chair the person is also referred to as the chair parliamentary procedure requires that members address the chair rather than the chairman or by using a persons name one of many customs intended to maintain the presiding officers impartiality and to ensure an objective and impersonal approach major dictionaries state that the word derives from chair a seat or office of authority and man a person some authorities however including riddicks rules of procedure suggest that the second part of chairman derives from the latin manus hand and thus claim genderneutrality for the word chairman as a quasititle gained particular resonance when socialist states from onwards shunned more traditional leadership labels and stressed the collective control of soviets councils or committees by beginning to refer to executive figureheads as chairman of the x committee vladimir lenin for example officially functioned as the head of soviet russia not as tsar or as president but in roles such as chairman of the council of peoples commissars of the russian sfsr note in particular the popular standard method for referring to mao zedong chairman mao officially first chairman of the central committee of the communist party of china vice chairman and deputy chairman edit a vicechairman or deputy chairman subordinate to the chairman is sometimes chosen to assist the chairman and to serve as chairman in the absence of the chairman or when a motion involving the chairman is being discussed in the absence of the chairman and vice chairman groups sometimes elect a chairman pro tempore to fill the role for a single meeting in some organizations that have both titles deputy chairman ranks higher than vice chairman as there are often multiple vice chairs but only a single deputy chair this type of deputy chairman title on its own usually has only an advisory role and not an operational one such as ted turner at time warner an unrelated definition of vice chair describes an executive who is higher ranking or has more seniority than an executive vice president sometimes evps report to a vice chair who in turn reports directly to the ceo so vice chairs in effect constitute an additional layer of management other vice chairs have more responsibilities but are otherwise on an equal tier with evps executive vice chairmen are usually not on the board of directors the royal bank of canada previously used vice chair in their inner management circle until but have since renamed them group head public corporations edit there are four types of chairman in public corporations chairman and ceo the ceo may also hold the title of chairman in which case the board frequently names an independent member of the board as a lead director chair and cgo an office that differs from ceo the chief governance officer is a position that ensures that governance processes are being followed within an organization and strives for best practices this position is common in a policy governance model executive chairman an office separate from that of ceo where the titleholder wields influence over company operations such as steve case of aol time warner larry ellison of oracle and douglas flint of hsbc in particular the group chairmanship of hsbc is considered the top position of that institution outranking the chief executive and is responsible for leading the board and representing the company in meetings with government figures prior to the creation of the group management board in hsbcs chairman essentially held the duties of a chief executive at an equivalent institution while hsbcs chief executive served as the deputy after the reorganization the management cadre ran the business while the chairman oversaw the controls of the business through compliance and audit and the direction of the business nonexecutive chairman also a separate post from the ceo unlike an executive chairman a nonexecutive chairman does not interfere in daytoday company matters across the world many companies have separated the roles of chairman and ceo often resulting in a nonexecutive chairman saying that this move improves corporate governance the nonexecutive chairmans duties are typically limited to matters directly related to the board such as chairing the meetings of the board organizing and coordinating the boards activities such as by setting its annual agenda reviewing and evaluating the performance of the ceo and the other board members many us companies have an executive chairman and this method of organization is sometimes called the american model having a nonexecutive chair is common in the united kingdom and canada and is sometimes called the british model expert opinion is rather evenly divided over which is the preferable model overall companies with both an executive
